# How to Run TypeScript Tests With Playwright on TestMu AI

> For the full site index for AI agents, see [llms.txt](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/llms.txt).

Learn how to use Playwright with TypeScript to automate web application testing across 50+ real browsers and operating systems on the TestMu AI cloud platform. You connect Playwright to the grid through a CDP WebSocket endpoint, pass your credentials and a `capabilities` object, then view the results on the Automation Dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Set up the following before you run the test so Playwright can authenticate and connect to the TestMu AI grid.

1. You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

**Sample repo**
Download or clone the code sample for the Playwright TypeScript from the TestMu AI GitHub repository to run the tests.

 View on GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
cd playwright-test-ts
```

2. Install the npm dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. A TestMu AI Username and Access key. You can get it from your TestMu AI Profile section. Don't have an account, sign up for free.

4. To run Playwright tests, set your TestMu AI Username and Access key in the Environment Variables.

## Run your Playwright tests with TypeScript

Navigate to the `lambdatest-setup.ts` file in the `playwright-test-ts` directory. This TypeScript fixture builds the capabilities object, connects Playwright to the grid, and reports the test status.

```ts title="lambdatest-setup.ts"
/**
 * Add the file in your test suite to run tests on LambdaTest.
 * Import `test` object from this file in the tests.
 */

import * as base from "@playwright/test";
import path from "path";
import { chromium } from "playwright";

// LambdaTest capabilities
const capabilities = {
  browserName: "Chrome", // Browsers allowed: `Chrome`, `MicrosoftEdge`, `pw-chromium`, `pw-firefox` and `pw-webkit`
  browserVersion: "latest",
  "LT:Options": {
    platform: "Windows 10",
    build: "Playwright TypeScript Build",
    name: "Playwright TypeScript Test",
    user: process.env.LT_USERNAME,
    accessKey: process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY,
    network: true,
    video: true,
    console: true,
    tunnel: false, // Add tunnel configuration if testing locally hosted webpage
    tunnelName: "", // Optional
    geoLocation: '', // country code can be fetched from https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/
  },
};

// Patching the capabilities dynamically according to the project name.
const modifyCapabilities = (configName, testName) => {
  let config = configName.split("@lambdatest")[0];
  let [browserName, browserVersion, platform] = config.split(":");
  capabilities.browserName = browserName
    ? browserName
    : capabilities.browserName;
  capabilities.browserVersion = browserVersion
    ? browserVersion
    : capabilities.browserVersion;
  capabilities["LT:Options"]["platform"] = platform
    ? platform
    : capabilities["LT:Options"]["platform"];
  capabilities["LT:Options"]["name"] = testName;
};

const getErrorMessage = (obj, keys) =>
  keys.reduce(
    (obj, key) => (typeof obj == "object" ? obj[key] : undefined),
    obj
  );

const test = base.test.extend({
  page: async ({ page, playwright }, use, testInfo) => {
    // Configure LambdaTest platform for cross-browser testing
    let fileName = testInfo.file.split(path.sep).pop();
    if (testInfo.project.name.match(/lambdatest/)) {
      modifyCapabilities(
        testInfo.project.name,
        `${testInfo.title} - ${fileName}`
      );

      const browser = await chromium.connect({
        wsEndpoint: `wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=${encodeURIComponent(
          JSON.stringify(capabilities)
        )}`,
      });

      const ltPage = await browser.newPage(testInfo.project.use);
      await use(ltPage);

      const testStatus = {
        action: "setTestStatus",
        arguments: {
          status: testInfo.status,
          remark: getErrorMessage(testInfo, ["error", "message"]),
        },
      };
      await ltPage.evaluate(() => {},
      `lambdatest_action: ${JSON.stringify(testStatus)}`);
      await ltPage.close();
      await browser.close();
    } else {
      // Run tests in local in case of local config provided
      await use(page);
    }
  },
});

export default test;
```

Pass the below command in the terminal to run the test.

```bash
npm run test
```

## View your test results

Go to the [TestMu AI Web Automation Dashboard](https://www.testmuai.com/login/?redirectTo=https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) to see your Playwright TypeScript test results.
