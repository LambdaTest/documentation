# Running Vanilla Framework Tests on HyperExecute
Playwright is a Node.js library that uses a single API to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It is designed to enable powerful, reliable, and efficient automated browser testing. Playwright can also automate Microsoft Edge since it is built on the open-source Chromium web framework.

HyperExecute is an AI Native Test Orchestration Cloud Platform that empowers you to run **end-to-end** tests **quickly** and **efficiently**. It provides Just-in-Time (JIT) testing infrastructure with fast execution **speeds**, **smart orchestration**, and **detailed logs**.

This guide details how to execute your **Vanilla** framework tests on **HyperExecute** via two different methods:

- [**Using Local System**](/support/docs/playwright-vanillajs-on-hyperexecute/#1-testing-using-local-system) - You can use your own local machine to execute tests.
- [**Using Gitpod Platform**](/support/docs/playwright-vanillajs-on-hyperexecute/#2-testing-using-gitpod) -  Execute tests using GitPod. (Requires a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/login/) account)

## 1. Testing Using Local System

Follow the step-by-step guide to execute your test on HyperExecute.

### Prerequisites

To run the Tests on HyperExecute from your Local System, you are required:

- Your <BrandName /> [Username and Access key](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-get-my-username-and-access-key/)
- [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-version0.2/) file which contains all the necessary instructions.
- [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) in order to initiate a test execution Job .
- Setup the [Environmental Variable](/support/docs/hyperexecute-environment-variable-setup/)

### Step 1: Configure Your Test Suite

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

:::tip Sample repo

Download or Clone the code sample for the JUnit from the <BrandName /> GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

<a href="https://github.com/LambdaTest/HyperExecute-Playwright-Vanilla-Javascript.git" className="github__anchor"><img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/icons/github.png').default} alt="Image" className="doc_img"/> View on GitHub</a>

:::

If you are using your own project, make sure you update the **Hub endpoint** in your tests file.

By setting up the Hub endpoint, you establish the communication channel between your tests and the browser nodes, enabling effective test distribution and execution.


<!-- Configure the desired capabilities based on your test requirements. For example: -->

> You can also use **dev** and **beta** browser versions. To generate capabilities for your test requirements, you can use our inbuilt 🔗 <a href={`${BRAND_URL}/capabilities-generator/`}>Capabilities Generator Tool</a>.

### Step 2: Setup the CLI in your Test Suite

After cloning / downloading the sample repo, you need to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

#### Download the HyperExecute CLI

The CLI is used for triggering the tests on HyperExecute. It is recommend to download the CLI binary on the host system and keep it in the root directory of the suite to perform the tests on HyperExecute.

You can download the CLI for your desired platform from the below mentioned links:

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| MacOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |

#### Setup Environment Variable

Now, you need to export your environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [<BrandName /> Profile page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).

Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="bash" label="Linux / MacOS" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="powershell" label="Windows" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    <CodeBlock className="language-powershell">
  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Configure YAML in your Test Suite

Configure your YAML file as per your use cases using **key value** pairs.

In this sample YAML file, we have mentioned:

- **version** of the YAML file
- **Timeouts** for executing your project
- **Mode of execution** is [Autosplit](/support/docs/hyperexecute-auto-split-strategy/). You can also opt for [Matrix](/support/docs/hyperexecute-matrix-multiplexing-strategy/) or [Hybrid](/support/docs/hyperexecute-hybrid-strategy/) mode.
- **Pre and Post** commands
- **Reports and Artefacts** that will be generated after the completion of tests
- and other necessary YAML Parameters

```yaml
---
version: "0.1"

globalTimeout: 90
testSuiteTimeout: 90
testSuiteStep: 90

runson: linux

autosplit: true

retryOnFailure: false
maxRetries: 1

concurrency: 2

pre:
  - npm install
  - npx playwright install

cacheKey: '{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}'
cacheDirectories:
  - node_modules

testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: dynamic
  command: grep -nri 'describe' tests  | sed 's/:test.*//'

testRunnerCommand: npx playwright test $test

jobLabel: [playwright-VanillaJS, linux, autosplit] 
```

### Step 4: Execute your Test Suite

> **NOTE :** In case of MacOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General tab**.

Run the below command in your terminal at the root folder of the project:

```bash
./hyperexecute --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

OR use this command if you have not exported your username and access key in the step 2.

<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
  <CodeBlock className="language-bash">
    {`./hyperexecute --user ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} --key ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()} --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE `}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

### Step 5: Monitor the Test Execution

Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/frameworks/selenium/testng/testng_autosplit_1.png').default} alt="automation-dashboard"  width="1920" height="868" className="doc_img"/>

### Step 6: Download Artifacts and Reports

HyperExecute also facilitates the provision to download the [Artifacts](/support/docs/hyperexecute-artifacts/) and [Reports](/support/docs/hyperexecute-reports/) on your local machine. Click on the corresponding button to download your generated artifacts and reports.

## 2. Testing Using Gitpod

You can also use the Gitpod platform to execute our sample repository. It will fetch all the sample codebases and trigger the CLI to execute the tests.

Follow the below steps to run Test using Gitpod:

**Step 1:**  Click '**Open in Gitpod**' button. You will be redirected to Login/Signup page. This button is configured to redirect you to the Gitpod platform where you will be able to execute our sample repository.

[<img alt="Run in Gitpod" width="200 px" align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1688653/165307331-fbcf16b0-ce49-40f5-9f87-4f080d674624.png" />](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/jobs?type=gitpod&frameworkType=Playwright&framework=Playwright-JS)

**Step 2:** Login with <BrandName /> credentials. Once logged in, a pop-up confirmation will appear, asking you to **'Proceed'** to the Gitpod editor in a new tab. The current tab will display the HyperExecute Dashboard.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/frameworks/gitpod_popup.png').default} alt="Gitpod popup" width="1919" height="878" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** Choose your preferred editor (we recommend VS Code Editor)

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/frameworks/gitpod_config.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:**  As you are running a sample project, Fetching of the Test Scripts, [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/), [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) and Triggering your tests using the `Execution Command` will be automated. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/hyperexecute/frameworks/gitpod2.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5:**  Once you see the `Job Link` in the logs, you can visit the [HyperExecute dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) to see the tests getting executed.

:::tip

You can also implement [Secret Keys](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-save-and-manage-secrets/) in your YAML file.

## Navigation in Automation Dashboard

Every test run on the HyperExecute has a unique *jobId* associated with it. Each *jobId* can in turn constitute single (or multiple) *groupId*(s). You can visit [HyperExecute Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) for checking the status of the test execution.

You can seamlessly navigate between JobId's and taskId's. You need to click on the *testID* to navigate from the HyperExecute logs to the Automation Dashboard.
