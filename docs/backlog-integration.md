# Backlog Integration

***
Backlog provides an online platform for project & code management. Using Backlog, you can collaborate with your teams working in different parts of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle). It lets you organize, discuss, and track all the work in one place. It offers out-of-the-box features to help you orchestrate your release cycles better. Some of the important features include Git hosting, Git version control, and issue tracking.

<BrandName /> integration with Backlog will help you file any UI bug on your Backlog project instance, directly from <BrandName />. If you ever come across a [browser compatibility](https://www.lambdatest.com/feature) bug while cross browser testing on <BrandName />, all you need to do is hit a single click and the bug will be logged into your Backlog project.

## How To Integrate Backlog With Your <BrandName /> Account?
***

**Step 1:** Login to your <BrandName /> account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integration’ from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your <BrandName /> account.

**Step 3:** Under the category of Project Management, click on the block that says **‘Backlog’**.

**Step 4:** You will be routed to the below screen where you are required to fill your Backlog URL and API key.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/backlog-2.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="1340" height="617" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5:** Login to your Backlog account and you will find the Backlog URL on top of your browser’s address bar.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/backlog-3.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="933" height="72" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** On top-right corner of your Backlog instance, you will find a drop-down menu with your profile icon. Click on the drop-down and go to "Personal Settings".

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/backlog-4.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="1352" height="595" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 7:** In your personal settings, go to API. Enter a random string of characters in the Memo field and hit the Submit button. You will find an API key generated based on the Memo. Copy this API key as it would be used to authenticate yourself while integrating <BrandName /> with Backlog.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/backlog-5.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="1344" height="526" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 8:** Paste your Backlog URL and API key on the <BrandName />, and then hit the Install button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/backlog-6.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="1352" height="615" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 9:** You will now be routed back to the integrations where you will notice a green tick over the block for Backlog indicating that the integration has been successful. The refresh button will help you synchronize your Backlog account with <BrandName /> in just a single click. So if in near future you add more projects on you backlog dashboard then all you need to do is hit that refresh icon and <BrandName /> will be able to fetch your latest projects instantly.

## Log Your First Bug From <BrandName /> Integration With Backlog
***

**Step 1:** Go for any of the test from the left navigation menu. For demo, we will be taking "Real Time Test" option.

**Step 2:** Present a URL of the web-app you need to test in the dialog box. After that, select any configuration for browser and operating system of your choice & hit ‘Start‘.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/backlog-8.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="1344" height="614" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** After the VM is launched and operable. You can perform testing on your web-app for finding bugs. If a bug gets revealed, then you need to click on the Bug icon from the left panel for [capturing a screenshot](https://www.lambdatest.com/full-page-screen-capture) of the same. We have highlighted that option with yellow in the below image.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/clickup-5.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="1325" height="653" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** After a screenshot is captured, you can annotate any issue or a task with an in-built image editor. Once you are done highlighting the bug, click on the button that says "Mark as Bug".

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/clickup-6.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5:** After clicking on "Mark as Bug" button a form specific to Backlog would open up. Fill the fields as per your requirement, and create the issue.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/backlog-9.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="1365" height="613" className="doc_img"/>

> Note: After you click on "Create Bug", you will be able to observe it being successfully marked through a single click effort. You will get prompt messages on top of your Virtual Machine indicating the progress of bug logging. After few seconds you will be notified with a prompt message "Bug successfully marked" indicating that the screenshot has been pushed to your Backlog project.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/backlog-integration/Capture15.webp').default} alt="Backlog Integration" width="347" height="75" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** Now, go to your Backlog project and you will notice your logged task under the specific project that you assigned it through <BrandName />. All the test environment details will already be present in the created task.

## Remove <BrandName /> Integration With Backlog

> You can work with one integration at a time. So if you would want to integrate to a similar 3rd party application, then you would have to remove your current integration. Here is how you can do that.

**Step 1:** Login to your <BrandName /> account.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integrations’ from the left-navigation menu. This will guide you to a screen where you will find 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your <BrandName /> account.

**Step 3:** Click on ‘REMOVE’. You can find the remove button under the ‘Backlog’ block which would be highlighted with a green tick.
