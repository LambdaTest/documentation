In our earlier posts, we learned about using TestNG parameters in our TestNG scripts. To jog your memory, Parameterization In TestNG helps us pass data through the code and prevent hard-coding. However, TestNG parameters enable us to pass the values only once per execution cycle. To overcome this, we can use DataProvider in TestNG that allows us to pass multiple parameters to a single test in a single execution. Using DataProviders, we can easily pass multiple values to a test in just one execution cycle.
Let us quickly jump onto understanding more about DataProvider in TestNG and how we can efficiently use them in our test scripts for  [Selenium test automation.](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation/)
