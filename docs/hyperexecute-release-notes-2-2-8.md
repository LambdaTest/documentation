With the all-new Team Management feature, enhance team collaboration across your organization's automation testing efforts. By enabling isolated testing environments, this functionality streamlines workflow and improves productivity within teams.

Here's why Team Management can be a game changer for your automation testing efforts:

- **Organized Test Management:** Easily group users and their corresponding tests based on specific projects, teams, or departments to keep your testing environment structured and efficient.

- **Improved Visibility and Control:** Administrators can now manage user access to specific test data, ensuring that sensitive or confidential tests are protected from unauthorized access.

- **Enhanced Team Collaboration:** This feature fosters better communication and knowledge sharing within teams, enabling a more integrated and informed testing process.
