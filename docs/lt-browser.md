## Running Your First Responsive Test With LT Browser

* * *

**Step 1:** Open the LT Browser. Provide the testing URL in the address bar and hit **Enter**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/LT-1.webp').default} alt="Open the LT Browser"  className="doc_img"  width="1366" height="727"/>

**Step 2:** Once you hit Enter, the website would be loaded on 50+ devices. You can select any device to start [responsive testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/responsive-test-online) from the sidebar on the left. You can also monitor two different devices side by side by adding a device on the view screen.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/LT-2.webp').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="723"/>

**Step 3:** After you click on the + button to add a new device, you will be prompted with a screen from which you can select the specific device you want to test side by side. Select the device and hit the button to **add device**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/LT-3.webp').default} alt="add device"  className="doc_img" width="1363" height="719"/>

**Step 4:** You will now find the added device on the view area inside LT Browser. That way you can compare responsive web design on 2 different device through a side by side view.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/LT-4.webp').default} alt="side by side"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="730"/>

### Rotating Device From Portrait To Landscape View Or Vice Versa

You can rotate any or both devices by clicking on the highlighted button with the **rotate icon**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/LT-5.webp').default} alt="rotate icom"  className="doc_img" width="1361" height="725"/>

### Couldn't Find Your Favourite Device? Add A Custom Device

Although, we try our best to deliver the most majorly used devices to our user as per the global market share. However, in case you are unable to find a device that matches the view port or device pixel ratio of your requirement then you can even add a custom device to your LT Browser. To do so, you need to click on the tab which says **add a custom device**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/LT-6.webp').default} alt="add custom device"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="662"/>

You will now be routed to the below screen where you can specify device details. You can specify:

*   Device Name
*   View Port Specifications
*   Device Pixel Ratio
*   User Agent String
*   Device Platform

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/custom-device-2.webp').default} alt="specify"  className="doc_img" width="805" height="597"/>

Let's try adding OnePlus 5 to the LT Browser. We will provide the mandatory details to add OnePlus 5 as a custom device.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/custom-device-3.webp').default} alt="custom device"  className="doc_img" width="1361" height="725"/>

As you click on add a device, you will find the custom device **One Plus 5** added to your [mobile view](https://www.lambdatest.com/mobile-view-website) area on the LT Browser. You will also find it added over the top of sidebar on the left with a bin icon to delete the custom device, if needed.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/LT-7.webp').default} alt="added device"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="726"/>

## How To Search For A Specific Device In The LT Browser?

* * *

If you open the LT Browser, you will notice a search bar displayed over the top-left. You can leverage the search bar to quickly find your favourite devices. After you search a string, you can select the particular device & the selected device will be rendered over the browser instantly.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/search.webp').default} alt="search"  className="doc_img" width="1365" height="721"/>

>**Fun Fact:** If you search for a device name which isn't added to your LT Browser yet, you will find a button that will help you instantly add a custom device.

## How To Capture A Screenshot & Highlight The Bugs?

* * *

**Step 1:** Click on the **camera icon** to [capture screenshot](https://www.lambdatest.com/full-page-screen-capture) of your website inside a mobile device screen of your choice.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/capture-screenshot.webp').default} alt="capture screenshot"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="720"/>

**Step 2:** Once you click on the camera icon, a built-in image editor would open up to present the captured screenshot of the selected device's screen.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/built-in-image-editor.webp').default} alt="Image editor"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="722"/>

>**Note:** The camera button won't capture a full-page screenshot but will capture screenshot of the view in the screen of a particular device. You can leverage our **[Automated Screenshot Testing](/docs/automated-screenshot-testing/)** to capture full-page screenshots of your website over multiple browsers + OS combinations in a single test session.

## How To Record Video Of A Test Session?

* * *

**Step 1:** Open you website in any device and click on the **video recording button**, you will be able to record your interaction of the website within the device.

**Step 2:** Perform live-interaction with your website. You will find a timer on top of the device. This timer indicates the length of the video recording of your live testing session. The timer will continue to run unless you stop the recording by clicking over the same **video recording button**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/video-timer.webp').default} alt="timer"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="768"/>

**Step 3:** After you stop the recording, you will find a message on top of the LT Browser indicating that your video of the test session has been successfully saved.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/video-saved.webp').default} alt="save video"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="768"/>

Now, to access this video you will need to go to Media.

## What Is Media?

* * *

To access any of your captured screenshots or recorded video, visit the Media. Consider Media as a Gallery which will comprise all your images and video that you may capture while testing your website through the LT Browser.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/media.webp').default} alt="media"  className="doc_img" width="1356" height="723"/>

## How To Test Locally Hosted Web-Apps or Websites?

* * *

All you need to do for testing your locally hosted web-apps or websites, is to provide the localhost string as the URL in the header of your **LT browser** and you'll be able to access your localhost server.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/htdocs-1.webp').default} alt="htdocs"  className="doc_img" width="1366" height="694"/>

All you have to do is open the localhost and append the URL with the webpage or website-folder you want to test.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/test-localhost.webp').default} alt="localhost"  className="doc_img" width="1365" height="721"/>
