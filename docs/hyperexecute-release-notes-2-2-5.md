## Improved Secrets Management 🔐
You can now specify a dedicated secrets file containing sensitive information like credentials and API keys.

These secrets within the designated file are accessible only within the scope of that particular job execution. This significantly reduces the risk of accidental exposure and improves overall security.

📗 Refer to our comprehensive [documentation](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/#--job-secret-file) for a better understanding.

## Microsoft Edge Canary Support for macOS 🚀
HyperExecute users running macOS can now leverage Microsoft Edge Canary for testing.
