<BrandName /> offers a comprehensive suite of real-time desktop web browser testing tools designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of your testing process. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to utilize each tool to its fullest potential.

## Screenshot
Capture high-quality screenshots of the current screen on your test device instantly. Screenshots are essential for documenting bugs, UI issues, and other anomalies during testing. Click on the Screenshot icon in the sidebar to take a snapshot of the current screen and will automatically start downloading in your local machine and it will be saved in the [gallery](/support/docs/real-time-desktop-browser-testing-tools/#gallery) as well.

## Record Session
Record your entire test session for detailed analysis and playback. Click on the Record Session button to begin recording. A timer will display the recording duration, helping you pinpoint specific moments during playback. To end the recording, click the Stop button. The recorded video will be saved automatically in the [gallery](/support/docs/real-time-desktop-browser-testing-tools/#gallery) for review.

## Gallery
The Gallery stores all screenshots and video recordings from your test sessions in one place, allowing you to easily review, download, or manage your media files. To access, select Gallery from the left toolbar and you'll find the saved screenshots and videos. To download the screenshots or videos to your local machine, click on the Download icon. You can also mark them as bug by clicking on the Bug icon.

## Mark as Bug
This feature allows you to mark any bug in your UI during the session. You can mark the bug in your UI via different shapes, texts and of different colors. You can also configure different project management tools with your session to create a ticket for the same. You can also share that bug, save the image to the gallery or download that screenshot.

## Resolution
Optimize your tests for different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure your web application looks and functions correctly on all devices. Adjust the resolution settings to simulate how your website will appear on different displays.

## Scaling
The Scaling feature allows you to adjust the display scale of your web application during testing to simulate different zoom levels or device pixel ratios. This helps ensure your web application looks and functions correctly at various zoom levels, as users might have different display settings on their devices.

## IP Geolocation
Simulate website and mobile experiences from over 45 countries using local IP addresses.
- **Why Use IP Geolocation? :** Test localized features such as language preferences, currency, regional product offerings, and content visibility based on a specific location.
- **How to Enable? :** Use the IP Geolocation feature to verify that your app's traffic originates from a specific country, providing a comprehensive global testing approach.

## Files and Media
The [Upload and Download Files](/support/docs/real-time-upload-and-download-files/) feature allows to manage files directly within remote testing environments. This functionality streamlines the testing process by allowing seamless file transfers between local and remote environments across desktop and mobile platforms.
