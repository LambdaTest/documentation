# Real Time Browser Testing

***
> Ensure your website is compatible across all browsers and devices. With LambdaTest, you can perform Real time Cross Browser compatibility testing of your website. You can choose from a wide range of updated Android and iOS mobile devices from the latest to oldest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Yandex. This live-interactive testing will help you deliver error free software as you perform your test to check the intended functionality of features on your website as an end user in real-time. Design your test cases, and feel free to run them through LambdaTest’s Real Time Testing.

## How To Launch VM?
***
**Step 1:** Login to your LambdaTest account. Go to “Real Time Test” from the left navigation menu.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/real-time-browser-testing-1.webp').default} alt="Real time browser" width="1365" height="668" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Select the test configuration of your choice. You can select from various major browsers & their different versions to perform a test session. You may also choose from multiple Desktop, Android, or iOS devices to test their respective operating system & screen resolutions for evaluating the RWD(Responsive Web Design) of a website when rendering on different resolutions.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/real-time-browser-testing-2.webp').default} alt="device resolution" width="1365" height="633" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** Provide the URL to test and hit `Start Icon` to launch your desired VM.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/real-time-browser-testing-3.webp').default} alt="realtime url" width="1365" height="645" className="doc_img"/>

## How To Capture Screenshots & Annotate Them With The Help Of An Image Editor?
***
**Step 1:** Once the desired VM is launched and operable, you will notice controller buttons on the screen's left side. Click the button with the Bug icon to [generate a screenshot](https://www.lambdatest.com/full-page-screen-capture) for the visible part of the screen you are currently on inside the VM.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/real-time-3.webp').default} alt="mark as bug"  width="1368" height="652"className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** As you click on the Bug icon, the image editor will pop up with various buttons to help you highlight and annotate your UI observation before sharing the screenshot with your colleagues.

- You can highlight the bug through different shapes like square, rectangular, circular or you can even underline.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/real-time-4.webp').default} alt="ui observation" width="1335" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

-  You can also scribble the bug using the pencil icon & can add text for annotating the screenshot with the help of text button.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/mark-as-bug-5.webp').default} alt="ui observation" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

-  Choose from a variety of colors for to make the bug more noticeable.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/mark-as-bug-6.webp').default} alt="Iui observation" width="1365" height="650" className="doc_img"/>

- The erasor icon highlighted below will help you to erase any unwanted highlights.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/mark-as-bug-7.webp').default} alt="ui observation" width="1365" height="652" className="doc_img"/>

-  If you have got too much to erase, then the last button at the bottom will do the job for you. It will help you undo any unwanted change in the screenshot.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/mark-as-bug-8.webp').default} alt="ui observation" width="1338" height="652" className="doc_img"/>

## How To Save & Share The Highlighted Screenshot?
***

**Step 1:** Once you are done highlighting the bug, you can save the screenshot in your LambdaTest’s gallery. You can download it on your external machine or even share it with a colleague using the buttons highlighted below.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/screeenshot.webp').default} alt="mark as bug" width="1338" height="652" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** The first button from the left, as highlighted below, will help you to share a bug directly to your teammate's email ID. You can add a note to help your colleague relate to your UI concern as you hit the 'SEND' button. You can even copy the shareable link for sharing it instantly outside your VM session.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/screenshot-1.webp').default} alt="download button" width="1338" height="652" className="doc_img"/>

<div className="youtube" data-embed="k3Bl0aqpzoA">
    <div className="play-button"></div>
</div>
</div>

**For Android:** It is straight forward, there is a button in the right side panel of the device that you can leverage to switch the orientation.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/resolution.webp').default} alt="device changed" width="1338" height="652" className="doc_img"/>

**For iOS devices:** Our iOS simulators are running on MacOS machines with auto hidden top menu. To rotate the device, you would have to hover the mouse pointer to the top of VM screen so that the top navigation menu drops down. In the navigation menu you would find a tab titled Hardware. (Make sure that you have selected the simulator app in VM by clicking on it.) Click on it to drop down the hardware menu, where you would find the rotate device buttons.
To summarize  Hover to top of VM screen  Hardware  Rotate Left/Right

**What Happens If You Wish To Test From Multiple Countries In Single Test Session?**
***
In case you wish to perform cross browser testing with multiple geolocations for a webpage in a single test session, then make sure to reload the browser provided inside the machine hosted by LambdaTest cloud servers after you have selected the new country to test from.

**Note:** We have not discarded the process of setting up a VPN of your own choice with LambdaTest. So in case you wish to perform Geolocation cross browser testing with a VPN of your preference, you can still do it.

## How To End The Running Session?
***
**Step 1:** You can end the running session by clicking on the power button at the bottom. The button would mention “End Session” as you hover your mouse on it.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/real-time-browser-testing/session-end.webp').default} alt="end session" width="1338" height="652" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** As you click on the power button, you will recieve a confirmatory pop-up for terminating the session. If you are sure about exiting the current session then click on the button highlighted in red that says “Yes, End Session”.

**Fun Fact:** You can change the position of controller buttons to any part of your screen by collapsing the panel with the help of ‘X’ button on the top of controller buttons. Doing so will transform the controller panel into a hamburger menu and you can place & expand it anywhere you like on the screen.
