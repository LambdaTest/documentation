It will take a few seconds for the Performance Report to generate.

### Desktop and Mobile Score

The Desktop and Mobile Score contains the universal score of the desktop and mobile scores. The score has three fields - Poor, Average, and Optimum.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/lt-browser-chromium/pr.png').default} alt="view screen"  className="doc_img" width="959" height="449"/><br/><br/>
