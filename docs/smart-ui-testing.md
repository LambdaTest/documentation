SmartUI Testing is a technique used by designers and front-end testers to ensure the visual consistency of web applications by employing a sort of testing called **"Visual Regression"**.

In Visual Regression testing, we compare screenshots and identify visual variations in the pixels. It is integrated with Lambdatest's HyperExecute, allowing you to execute **Smart UI** Tests on the platform.

## Features of SmartUI Testing
HyperExecute's SmartUITesting offers the following features:

- **Pixel-to-Pixel Comparison:** Perform accurate visual regression testing by comparing screenshots at the pixel level.
- **Multi-browser and Resolution Tests:** Run tests simultaneously across multiple browsers and resolutions to ensure consistent user experience.
- **Webhook Integration:** Connect SmartUI Testing with your automation test suite using webhook configurations.
- **Project Collaboration:** Add up to 5 approvers/tags to a project for streamlined collaboration and easy navigation.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Approvers are notified of test status changes, enabling prompt action and communication.

To execute SmartUI Testing using HyperExecute, you can opt for the following methods:
