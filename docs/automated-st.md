# Automated Screenshot Testing
> This feature is **deprecated** and as a result, no further support will be provided for this feature by the <BrandName /> Organization. 

***
Automated Screenshot testing will help you capture screenshots in bulk through different desktops and mobile devices running on various OS in a single go! It is facilitated by instrumented UI test cases to help you realize how seamlessly your web app renders through different screen sizes using different browsers. At <BrandName />, you can capture up to 25 screenshots of different browsers and OS configurations in a single session. You can choose from a wide range of latest to oldest browser versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Internet Explorer & Opera. Also, you can test on different operating systems Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.
