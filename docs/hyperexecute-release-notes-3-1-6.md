## Chrome for Testing Browser Support
HyperExecute now supports Chrome for Testing, enabling more reliable and version-controlled browser testing across automation workflows.

### Why This Matters
Traditional Chrome auto-updates can introduce test instability due to unexpected version changes. Chrome for Testing provides:
- Predictable browser versions
- Better alignment with corresponding ChromeDriver versions
- More stable and debuggable test runs in CI/CD pipelines

### How It Helps You
- Run tests against specific Chrome versions without surprises
- Reduce flaky failures caused by browser mismatches
- Maintain consistency across local, staging, and CI executions
