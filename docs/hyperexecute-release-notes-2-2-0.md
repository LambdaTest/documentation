## Enhance your UI Testing Experience

You can selectively exclude specific elements from visual comparisons during your automated tests.

### Advantages of `ignoreDOM` flag

- **Handling Dynamic Content :** Exclude elements that frequently change, like timestamps or user-generated content, to avoid false positives.

- **Focusing on core functionality :** Zero in on critical elements by ignoring UI components like headers, footers, or navigation menus.

- **Testing Specific Sections :** Target a particular area of your webpage for more granular testing.
