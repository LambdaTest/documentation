## Key Features

- **Accessibility Scanning:** The DevTools can scan entire web pages (full page scan), specific website elements (partial page scan), or even multiple pages simultaneously (multi-page scan) to identify accessibility violations.
- **Compliance with Standards:** The scanning process is powered by Axe-core, a popular accessibility testing engine, and helps ensure your website adheres to accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
- **Detailed Reporting:** After a scan, the DevTools generate a comprehensive report that details all identified accessibility issues. This report includes the severity level (critical, serious, or minor) of each issue, along with a clear explanation and suggested remediation steps.

## Benefits of LambdaTest Accessibility DevTools

- **Improved User Experience:** By identifying and fixing accessibility issues, you create a website that's usable for everyone, including users with disabilities.
- **Reduced Legal Risks:** Many countries have regulations regarding website accessibility. Using the DevTools helps mitigate potential legal risks associated with non-compliance.
- **Enhanced SEO:** Accessible websites tend to rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) as search engines consider accessibility a factor.
