# Jobs Archiving

HyperExecute's job archiving feature lets you seamlessly organize your workspace by tucking away irrelevant jobs, enhancing your team's efficiency. By archiving jobs, you ensure that only the most relevant and significant jobs occupy your workspace, enabling your team to stay focused and productive.

## Archive the Jobs

In order to archive any job, just click on the elipsis (three dots) that you see on the right side on job list page, it would provide you a small dropdown to be able to archive that job.

> Archived jobs are not deleted, they are just removed from the default view on this page.

## View the Archived Jobs

In order to view the archived jobs, you can simply go to filters and select view archived jobs. All the jobs that you archive, will be available here.
