# HyperExecute Feature FAQs

***

#### 1. **How can I integrate HyperExecute with other CI/CD platforms?**

  Since HyperExecute is operated using a universal CLI, it essentially takes two lines of terminal commands to integrate HyperExecute with any CI/CD platform. You need to download the CLI and trigger it to do this.

***

#### 2. **How is HyperExecute different from other testing clouds?**

  While other testing platforms throw infrastructure at the users to run their tests, HyperExecute is a smart orchestration cloud where the platform decides the best execution plan to finish the jobs in the least amount of time. HyperExecute accomplishes this by distributing tests smartly on available resources, providing other features, such as, retrying failed scenarios, automatic reordering and more. HyperExecute acts as a co-pilot for developers to run and triage their tests as fast as possible.

***

#### 3. **What smart CI features does HyperExecute provide?**

  HyperExecute provides you with the option to run pre and post steps that allow users to run any command before and after running tests on every VM, define custom environment variables, deep dependency caching, pick a specific version of language runtimes, artifacts management, and more. HyperExecute allows you to move your sophisticated pipelines for end to end testing completely. Triggering and execution of tests happens entirely on HyperExecute infrastructure and frees your CI or local system to do other meaningful tasks.

***
#### 4. **Can I test my private web applications on HyperExecute?**

  Absolutely. HyperExecute allows multiple provisions to test private applications by the following directives: automatically running tunnels using the CLI, and by creating dedicated NAT for organizations that can be whitelisted by their firewalls. We have users who are able to run VPN clients in the pre steps before starting their tests which allows them to securely connect to their private workloads.

***

#### 5. **Can I do geolocation testing on HyperExecute?**

  Yes, HyperExecute provides geolocation testing by providing capabilities in selenium, playwright, and cypress tests. All the geolocation testing features available on the standard platform are available on HyperExecute.

***

#### 6. **Can HyperExecute run my tests on virtual machines with custom specifications?**

  Yes, with the enterprise version, HyperExecute provides directives to use custom virtual machines based on the HyperExecute base virtual machine image. This allows for greater flexibility to run customer frameworks.

***

#### 7. **Can I use HyperExecute to run test cases on Microsoft Excel?**

  Yes, you can configure HyperExecute to run your Microsoft Excel test cases. However, this feature is only available on request at this moment. Visit [our documentation](/support/docs/hyperexecute-winapp-integration/) for this feature or contact support@testmu.ai to know more.
