## Bamboo CI/CD Integration

Bamboo is a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) server from Atlassian. It helps teams automate the software development and delivery process, from code commit to production deployment. Bamboo can be used to build, test, and deploy software on a variety of platforms, including cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.

The new integration between Bamboo CI and HyperExecute will allow teams to execute their tests on HyperExecute's cloud infrastructure seamlessly. This can help teams significantly shorten their test cycles and deliver software faster.

## GoCD Integration

GoCD, short for "Go Continuous Delivery," is an open-source continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) server that helps automate and streamline the software development and release process. It is designed to facilitate the efficient and reliable delivery of software from development to production.

The integration between GoCD and HyperExecute will allow teams to execute their tests on HyperExecute's cloud infrastructure seamlessly and shorten the test cycles and deliver software faster.
