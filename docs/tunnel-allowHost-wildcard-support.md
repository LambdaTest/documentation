LambdaTest Tunnel now supports wildcard entries in the [`--allowHosts`](https://lambdatest.com/support/docs/lambda-tunnel-modifiers/#:~:text=TYPE-,%2D%2DallowHosts,-Comma%20separated%20list) flag. This enhancement allows users to specify patterns for hostnames instead of listing each subdomain separately, making it more flexible and efficient.

## Usage of `--allowHosts` with Wildcards
The `--allowHosts` flag enables users to define which domains should be routed through the LambdaTest Tunnel while allowing other traffic to bypass it. With the new wildcard support, you can match multiple subdomains easily.

### Formatting Domains with Wildcards
Follow these guidelines when using wildcards in domain names:

#### Use only the domain name
- Do not include `http://` or `https://`.
- ✅ Example: `example.com`.       

#### Comma-separated list without spaces 
- Ensure that the list of domains is comma-separated with no spaces.
- ✅ Example: `example.com`, `testsite.com`, `anotherdomain.com`

#### Using Wildcards to Match Subdomains
- Prefix the domain with a dot `(.)` to match all its subdomains.
- Alternatively, you can use an asterisk `(*)` for the same effect.
- ✅ Example:
  - `".example.com"` or `"*.example.com"` will match `sub.example.com`, `api.example.com`, `blog.example.com`, etc.

:::tip Note
Enclose the argument in **quotes** to prevent shell expansion of the **asterisk (*)**.
