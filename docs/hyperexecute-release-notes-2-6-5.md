## New Regions Added for HyperExecute Performance Testing
We are excited to announce the addition of four new regions for performance testing in HyperExecute. These regions enable better coverage, reduced latency, and enhanced testing capabilities for global users.

The new regions are:
- **Central India** - Pune, Maharashtra
- **Malaysia** - Southeast Asia (Singapore)
- **Argentina** - South America (Brazil South)
- **Mexico** - Mexico Central

> 📕 Visit our [Performance Testing Documentation](/support/docs/hyperexecute-run-jmeter-tests/) for step-by-step instructions on configuring your tests and making the most of HyperExecute's enhanced regional coverage.

## Download Reports for XCUI Framework
Now, you can download the [JUnit XML report](/support/docs/junit-xml-report/) for your test runs on the XCUI framework.

To generate reports for your XCUI tests, add the `reports: true` flag in your [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-parameters/) file and pass the `--download-report` flag with the CLI command.

> 📕 Refer to our detailed documentation to [Generate XCUI Reports](/support/docs/hyperexecute-xcui-testing/#step-5-generate-reports-and-artifacts)
