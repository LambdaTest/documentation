## Workflows for JMeter Projects
HyperExecute now supports Workflows for JMeter projects, enabling teams to orchestrate, automate, and manage performance test execution more efficiently within CI/CD pipelines.

### Why This Matters
Performance testing often needs more than a single test run. Workflows allow you to:

- Improve repeatability and reliability of load and performance testing
- Align JMeter tests with real-world CI/CD practices

### How It Helps You

- Reduces manual intervention in performance testing
- Improves visibility and control over JMeter executions in HyperExecute
