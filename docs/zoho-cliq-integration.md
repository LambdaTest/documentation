# Zoho Cliq Integration

Zoho Cliq is a team communication and collaboration platform designed to enhance productivity and streamline communication within organizations. It offers a range of features to facilitate real-time messaging, audio and video calls, file sharing, and integrations with other business applications.


Integrating <BrandName /> with Zoho Cliq, users can create detailed test cards in Zoho Cliq Channels for logged bugs in <BrandName />. This will notify you and your team members every time a new bug is pushed while performing [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com) of your website from the <BrandName /> platform to your Zoho Cliq instance.
