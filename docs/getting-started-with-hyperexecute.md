HyperExecute is an AI Native Test Orchestration Cloud Platform, enabling test automation teams worldwide to achieve an accelerated time to market by providing JIT (Just-in-time) testing infrastructure that offers enhanced test execution speeds, smart test orchestration, detailed execution logs and much more.

It requires a [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/) file which contains all the necessary instructions and a [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) in order to initiate a test execution Job.

> Let's understand the [HyperExecute Dashboard](/support/docs/hyperexecute-guided-walkthrough/) together.
