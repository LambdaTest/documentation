LambdaTest and Webex Teams can be integrated to create detailed test cards in Webex Team Spaces for logged bugs in LambdaTest. This will notify you and your team members every time a new bug is pushed while performing [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com) of your website from the LambdaTest platform to your Webex Teams instance.

## One-Click Bug Logging With Webex Teams
***

**Step 1:** In your LambdaTest Dashboard, head to **Real-Time Testing > Browser Testing** from the left navigation menu.

Upon clicking, a cloud-based virtual machine will fire up, running real browsers and operating systems where you can test websites and web apps for filing bugs.

**Step 3:** Click on the **Bug icon** from the left in-session toolbar to take a screenshot of any bug you encounter.

**Step 5:** In the Webex ticket, fill the bug details like **Assignee, Issue Type, Priority, Summary,** and **Description** and check the **Send to Webex** option. Then click **Mark As Bug** to log the bugs in Webex Teams.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/webex-teams-integration/webex-nine.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>
