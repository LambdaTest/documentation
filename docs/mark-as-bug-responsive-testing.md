## How Can I Mark As Bug While Responsive Testing?
***

**Note:** Below is a demonstration of marking a bug from Responsive testing.

**Step 1:** Go to Responsive testing from the left navigation menu, provide the testing URL, and hit the **Generate** button to start your responsive test session.

**Step 2:** Once you hit the **Generate** button. You will find a loader  on devices mentioned on the right side of the screen, an indication that the screenshot test has begun. A counter will represent the number of devices for which the screenshot has been successfully generated. You can **stop** the test anytime by using the Stop button.

**Step 3:** Once your responsive test session is complete, you can perform a vertical-scroll to find your desired device for ensuring your RWD(Responsive Web Design). After selecting the device, double-click on the camera icon on top for marking a bug.

**Step 4:** As you double-click on any screenshot, an image editor will pop up with various buttons to help you highlight and annotate your UI observation before sharing the screenshot with your colleagues.

 - You can highlight the bug through different shapes like square, rectangular, circular, or you can even underline. Environment details of the test will be presented at the bottom-left of the image editor.

  - You can also scribble the bug using the pencil icon & add text for annotating the screenshot with the text button's help.
