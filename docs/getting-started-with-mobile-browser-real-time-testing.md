Real-Time Mobile Web Browser Testing allows you to test websites and web applications across different mobile browsers and operating systems, such as Android, iOS, and ChromeOS, in real-time. This process helps ensure that your web applications are fully functional, visually consistent, and optimized for various mobile devices, enhancing the user experience across different platforms. Using <BrandName />, developers, testers, and QA professionals can validate their web applications without the need for physical devices, all from a unified, user-friendly interface.

## Understanding the Dashboard
The <BrandName /> dashboard is designed to simplify the testing process. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

- **Operating System Tabs :** Located at the top, this section allows you to toggle between different operating systems (Android, iOS, and ChromeOS).

- **Browser Selection :** Below the OS tabs, a dropdown lets you choose the browser you want to test on. Available options may vary depending on the selected OS.

- **Device Selection Pane :** This panel lists the available devices manufacturers and models. You can quickly search for a device using the search bar, or filter by manufacturer (e.g., Samsung, Google, Apple). The list also displays the OS version supported for each device.

- **URL Field :** The top portion of the dashboard provides a field to enter the target URL.

- **Switch to Real Devices :** If you need to perform tests on physical devices, click on the Switch to Real Devices link to access <BrandName />'s real device cloud.

- **Tunnel :** For testing on environments that are not publicly accessible, configure the Tunnel settings to enable testing on staging or local sites.

- **Start Button :** Located on the right side of the URL field, this button initializes the testing session once you have chosen your device and browser configuration.
