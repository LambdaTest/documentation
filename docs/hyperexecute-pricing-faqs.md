# HyperExecute Pricing FAQs

***

#### 1. **Is there any limit on parallel testing on HyperExecute?**

  No, HyperExecute can provide virtually unlimited nodes to you for massive parallel testing as it is backed and spanned across multiple clouds. We have users distributing tests across thousands of nodes.

***

#### 2. **How does the licensing for HyperExecute work?**

  Each parallel test execution consumes a single HyperExecute license. For example, if you want to run 50 tests in parallel, you need 50 HyperExecute licenses. If you have 10 HyperExecute licenses and trigger 50 tests, only 10 will run in parallel and the rest 40 will be queued by the platform. Once every test finishes the execution, it will be dequeued and moved to the running state.

***

#### 3. **How many parallel tests can I run on a single HyperExecute license?**

  Each parallel test execution consumes a single HyperExecute license. HyperExecute puts no capping on the number of parallel tests that can run simultaneously. We have users running thousands of tests in parallel.

***

#### 4. **Can I use the standard <BrandName /> automation platform with the HyperExecute license?**

  Each HyperExecute license provides access to standard automation platforms and features. This makes transitioning to HyperExecute easier and makes sure that the best cross-browser platform features are still available to users purchasing a HyperExecute license.
