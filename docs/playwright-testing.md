# Getting Started With Playwright Testing
* * *
Playwright is a Node.js library that uses a single API to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. It is designed to enable powerful, reliable, and efficient [automated browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/automated-browser-testing). Playwright can also automate Microsoft Edge since it is built on the open-source Chromium web framework.

<BrandName /> allows you to run Playwright tests across 40+ real browsers and operating system combinations. This guide will cover the basics of getting started with Playwright testing on the <BrandName /> platform.


*You can run tests using Playwright versions **v1.15.0** to the latest.*

## Prerequisites
***

>Note: All the code samples in this documentation can be found in the <BrandName />'s Repository on GitHub. You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests.
<a href="https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample/" className="github__anchor"><img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/icons/github.png').default} alt="Image"  className="doc_img"/> View on GitHub</a>

1. Clone the <BrandName />-Playwright repository on your system.

2. Install the npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. Add browserWSEndpoint (browser end point URL) in your test script.

```js
wsEndpoint: `wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(capabilities))}`
```

4. In order to run your Playwright tests, you will need to set your <BrandName /> username and access key in the environment variables. Click the **Access Key** button at the top-right of the Automation Dashboard to access it.

**Windows**

```js
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**macOS/Linux**

```js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

## Run Your First Test
---

1. Add the below code snippet in your test scripts.

```js
(async () => {
  const capabilities = {
    'browserName': 'Chrome', // Browsers allowed: `Chrome`, `MicrosoftEdge`, `pw-chromium`, `pw-firefox` and `pw-webkit`
    'browserVersion': 'latest',
    'LT:Options': {
      'platform': 'Windows 10',
      'build': 'Playwright Sample Build',
      'name': 'Playwright Sample Test',
      'user': process.env.LT_USERNAME,
      'accessKey': process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY,
      'network': true,
      'video': true,
      'console': true
    }
  }

  const browser = await chromium.connect({
    wsEndpoint: `wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(capabilities))}`
  })
  ```

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Playwright test on <BrandName />. 

The below test script searches the term '<BrandName />' on Bing.

```js
const { chromium } = require('playwright')
const { expect } = require('@playwright/test');

(async () => {
  const capabilities = {
    'browserName': 'Chrome', // Browsers allowed: `Chrome`, `MicrosoftEdge`, `pw-chromium`, `pw-firefox` and `pw-webkit`
    'browserVersion': 'latest',
    'LT:Options': {
      'platform': 'Windows 10',
      'build': 'Playwright Sample Build',
      'name': 'Playwright Sample Test',
      'user': process.env.LT_USERNAME,
      'accessKey': process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY,
      'network': true,
      'video': true,
      'console': true
    }
  }

  const browser = await chromium.connect({
    wsEndpoint: `wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=${encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(capabilities))}`
  })

  const page = await browser.newPage()

  await page.goto('https://www.bing.com')

  const element = await page.$('[aria-label="Enter your search term"]')
  await element.click()
  await element.type('LambdaTest')
  await element.press('Enter')
  const title = await page.title()

  try {
    expect(title).toEqual('LambdaTest - Search')
    // Mark the test as completed or failed
    await page.evaluate(_ => {}, `lambdatest_action: ${JSON.stringify({ action: 'setTestStatus', arguments: { status: 'passed', remark: 'Title matched' } })}`)
  } catch {
    await page.evaluate(_ => {}, `lambdatest_action: ${JSON.stringify({ action: 'setTestStatus', arguments: { status: 'failed', remark: 'Title not matched' } })}`)
  }

  await browser.close()
})()

```

2. Pass the below command to run the test.

```
node playwright-single.js
```

## View your Playwright test results
***

The <BrandName /> Automation Dashboard is where you can see the results of your Playwright tests after running them on the <BrandName /> platform. 

The below screenshot of <BrandName /> Automation Dashboard shows the Playwright build on the left and the build sessions associated with the selected build on the right.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/playwright-testing/dashboard.webp').default} alt="Image" width="1444" height="703"  className="doc_img"/>

On clicking the session name of the respective test, you can view the details of Playwright test session that you just executed. For example, the below screenshot shows a test execution details of Playwright test like Test Name, Test ID, selected configurations, test logs, basic info, input config, and test session video.
