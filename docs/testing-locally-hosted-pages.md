**LambdaTest Tunnel** is a secure and encrypted tunneling feature that allows devs and QAs to test their locally hosted web applications or websites on the cloud-based real machines. It establishes a secure connection between the userâ€™s local machine and the real machine in the cloud. There are multiple connectivity options like **TCP with TLS 1.2 over port 443**, **Websocket (port 443)**,. Tunnel Binary performs network scanning and selects the best mode if not explicitly specified.

> All Tunnel credentials (access keys, API tokens, etc.) are private and confidential. A system compromise may result in their unauthorized disclosure; therefore, you must secure the machine running the LambdaTest tunnel. Do not share or expose credentials in public code, repositories, or environments. In the event of a compromise, you are solely responsible for immediately revoking and regenerating the credentials. LambdaTest assumes no liability for any losses arising from failure to comply. 

## Why to Use LambdaTest Tunnel?

LambdaTest Tunnel offers numerous benefits for web developers, testers, and QA professionals. These include secure and encrypted connection, cross-browser compatibility testing, localhost testing, etc.

- **Secured and Encrypted :** It provides a secure and encrypted connection between your local machine and the virtual machines in the cloud, thereby ensuring the privacy of your test data and online communications.
- **Cost Effective :** With LambdaTest Tunnel, you can test your web applications or websites, local folder, and files across a wide range of browsers and operating systems without setting up complex and expensive local testing environments.
- **Test on Real Environment :** It lets you test your locally hosted web applications or websites on cloud-based real OS machines. You can even run accessibility tests on desktop browsers while testing locally hosted web applications and pages.

> Please note that the LambdaTest tunnel client does not include any AI or ML capabilities, and none of the data it proxies is used for AI or ML training.
