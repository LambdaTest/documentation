# Integrating Wrike With <BrandName />
***

>Wrike is a SaaS(Software-As-A-Service) Product Management software. You can manage and track your projects, deadlines, and other workflow processes. It also allows inter-team communications, and therefore used by many developments, as well as testing teams to keep track of their work and teams. Wrike also provides the ability to track bugs effectively.

<BrandName /> Wrike integration helps you in creating issues in Wrike directly from the <BrandName /> platform. <BrandName /> now allows you to integrate your Wrike workspace with simple one-click. You can push annotated issues to a project of your choice, assign it to the required teammate, set the priority, and attach screenshots in the middle of the test session. After creating the issue, it gets reflected directly in your project's workspace on Wrike with the details of the test session along with the annotated screenshot.

**Wrike Integration with <BrandName />, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.**

## Integrate Wrike With Your <BrandName /> Account

**Step 2:** Select **‘Integrations’** tab from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, that have already been integrated as well as that are available to integrate with your <BrandName /> account. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/select-wrike-integration.webp').default} alt="select wrike"  className="doc_img" width="1923" height="864"/>

**Step 4:** You need to [create an account on Wrike](https://login.wrike.com/login/) to integrate your workspace with <BrandName />. If you don't have an account, you can create one even in the middle of this integration in the this step. If you are already logged in, this step won't appear in the integration process. <img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/login-into-wrike.webp').default} alt="login"  className="doc_img" width="781" height="762"/>

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/fill-form-and-create-issue-for-wrike.webp').default} alt="fill form"  className="doc_img" width="706" height="777"/>


> *   Select the **Folder** from your Wrike workspace, in which you want to create this issue.
> *   You can assign the bug to a member of your team or yourself, by selecting from the drop-down of field '**Assignee**'.
> *   Set the **Priority** of the bug as per convenience.
> *   Give a title to your bug in the "Title" field.
> *   Also, post an optional **description** to help the assignee with the bug tracking.

Now click on **"Create Bug"** button create the bug and send the bug directly to selected project.  

**Step 6:** After you click on **"Create Bug"**, you will be able to observe it being successfully marked through a single click effort. You will get **prompt messages** on top of your Virtual Machine indicating the progress of bug logging. After few seconds you will be notified with a prompt message "**Bug successfully marked**" indicating that the screenshot has been pushed to your Wrike workspace.

**Step 7:** Login to your workspace on Wrike and you will be able to notice the marked bug in the set channel assigned to the selected person. All the data you provided through <BrandName /> form would already be presented in it. <BrandName /> automatically includes test environment details and related screenshots in the screenshot as attachments.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/bug-on-wrike.webp').default} alt="wrike bug"  className="doc_img" width="1670" height="790"/>

A clickable link will be provided in the Wrike channel along with the screenshot to instantly route users on their browser for a full screen view of the bug.

## How To Remove Wrike Integration?

* * *

> You can work with one integration at a time. So if you would want to integrate to a similar 3rd party application, then you would have to **remove** your current integration. Here is how you can do that.

**Step 1:** Login to your <BrandName /> account.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integrations’ from the left navigation menu bar & go to 'Product Management' category. This will guide you to a screen where you will find 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your <BrandName /> account. You can also remove it using the 'My Integrations' tab on the Integrations tab.

**Step 3:** On the Wrike block. A **"REMOVE"** button will appear. Click on **‘REMOVE’**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/uploads/click-on-remove.webp').default} alt="remove"  className="doc_img" width="812" height="738"/>
