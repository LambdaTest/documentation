Axosoft Integration with LambdaTest streamlines the software development team's project management and testing processes. With a simple one-click integration, you can seamlessly create and manage issues during [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/online-browser-testing). This integration enables you to push annotated issues to specific projects, assign them to team members, set priorities, and attach relevant screenshots during test sessions. The created issues are automatically reflected in your Axosoft workspace, complete with test session details and annotated screenshots, facilitating efficient issue tracking and resolution within your project management environment.

Axosoft Integration with LambdaTest, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium and premium plans.


## Integrate Axosoft With Your LambdaTest Account
***

**Step 1:** Log in to your [LambdaTest account](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register). You need to have Admin or User level access to see and install 3rd party integrations.

**Step 2:** Select the ‘Integrations’ tab from the left navigation menu bar under "Settings". This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, that have already been integrated as well as that are available to integrate with your LambdaTest account.

**Step 3:** Hover to the 'Axosoft' block under the "Project Management" category, and click on the "plus" button that appears.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/axosoft-integration/axosoft-two.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** You need to [create an account on Axosoft](https://www.axosoft.com/) to integrate your workspace with LambdaTest. If you don't have an account, you can create one. If you are already logged in, this step won't appear in the integration process. You will be required to enter the URL and OAuth token to enable integration. The Axosoft Base URL can be copied from the Axosoft website.

**Step 5:** To generate an OAuth token for integration, go to your Axosoft Account, click on Tools, then select System Settings.

**Step 3:** After the VM is launched and operable, you can perform testing on your mobile app as per your choice, such as to find issues. Suppose you come across any bug, then you need to click on the Bug icon from the left panel, to capture a screenshot of the current VM instance. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/axosoft-integration/axosoft-twelve.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/axosoft-integration/axosoft-thirteen.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/axosoft-integration/axosoft-fourteen.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:** You will now observe it being successfully marked through a single click effort. You will get prompt messages on top of your Virtual Machine indicating the progress of bug logging. After a few seconds, you will be notified with a prompt message "Bug successfully marked" indicating that the screenshot has been pushed to your workspace. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/axosoft-integration/axosoft-fifteen.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>


**Step 7:** Log in to your workspace on Axosoft and you will be able to notice the marked bug in the set channel assigned to the selected person. All the data you provided through the LambdaTest form would already be presented in it. LambdaTest automatically includes test environment details and related screenshots in the screenshot as attachments.

## How To Remove Axosoft Integration?
***

You can work with one integration at a time. So if you want to integrate into a similar 3rd party application, then you would have to remove your current integration. Here is how you can do that.

**Step 1:** Log in to your LambdaTest account.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integrations’ from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you can remove the Axosoft integration under the tab that says "My Integrations".

**Step 3:** On the Axosoft block, a "REMOVE" button will appear. Click on ‘REMOVE’. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/axosoft-integration/axosoft-seventeen.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** Upon pressing 'REMOVE', a message will prompt on the top right corner of the app stating the same. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/axosoft-integration/axosoft-eighteen.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>
