Axosoft Integration with <BrandName /> streamlines the software development team's project management and testing processes. With a simple one-click integration, you can seamlessly create and manage issues during [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/online-browser-testing). This integration enables you to push annotated issues to specific projects, assign them to team members, set priorities, and attach relevant screenshots during test sessions. The created issues are automatically reflected in your Axosoft workspace, complete with test session details and annotated screenshots, facilitating efficient issue tracking and resolution within your project management environment.

Axosoft Integration with <BrandName />, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium and premium plans.


## Integrate Axosoft With Your <BrandName /> Account
***

**Step 1:** Log in to your [<BrandName /> account](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register). You need to have Admin or User level access to see and install 3rd party integrations.

**Step 2:** Select the ‘Integrations’ tab from the left navigation menu bar under "Settings". This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, that have already been integrated as well as that are available to integrate with your <BrandName /> account.

**Step 4:** You need to [create an account on Axosoft](https://www.axosoft.com/) to integrate your workspace with <BrandName />. If you don't have an account, you can create one. If you are already logged in, this step won't appear in the integration process. You will be required to enter the URL and OAuth token to enable integration. The Axosoft Base URL can be copied from the Axosoft website.

## How To Remove Axosoft Integration?

You can work with one integration at a time. So if you want to integrate into a similar 3rd party application, then you would have to remove your current integration. Here is how you can do that.

**Step 1:** Log in to your <BrandName /> account.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integrations’ from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you can remove the Axosoft integration under the tab that says "My Integrations".

**Step 3:** On the Axosoft block, a "REMOVE" button will appear. Click on ‘REMOVE’. 

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/axosoft-integration/axosoft-seventeen.webp').default} alt="add" width="1346" height="647" className="doc_img"/>
