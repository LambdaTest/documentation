With <BrandName /> Real Devices, you can interact with the built-in Contacts app on our real devices to test your app's functionality. To support diverse testing, we've included sample contact data for you to use.

## Supported Devices
<BrandName /> supports access to the dummy Contacts on the following devices:

- Devices running Android 10 and higher(Except Tabs).
- Devices running iOS 13 and higher.

## What you can test?
With access to the Contacts app on the remote devices, you can now test scenarios, such as:

- Access contacts from the Contacts app.
- Add/Save your custom contacts to the Contacts app.
- Edit/delete a contact.
