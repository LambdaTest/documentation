# AWS CodePipeline Integration With <BrandName />

AWS CodePipeline is a cloud-based continuous delivery platform for fully automating your release pipelines. Provides an intuitive interface for configuring & modeling different stages of release cycles, so you can envision how your code changes would look when pushed across these different changes. You can also track your pipeline in real-time, and look into the pipeline history to understand the timestamps involved in the execution of various pipelines.

<BrandName /> integration with AWS CodePipeline will help you perform automated cross browser testing through a Selenium Grid offering 3000+ real browsers, browser versions. Now, not only can you commit changes to your code using AWS CodePipeline, but you can also validate any UI/UX anomalies of your web application through a wide variety of browsers using <BrandName />, a cloud-based cross browser testing tool.

## Prerequisite
***

* Login details in [AWS CodePipeline CI](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/).
* A GitHub repository. Here is our sample GitHub repository for [AWS CodePipeline](https://github.com/LambdaTest/protractor-selenium-awscodepipeline-sample.git).
* **<BrandName /> Authentication Credentials**   
   Be aware of your <BrandName /> authentication credentials, i.e., your <BrandName /> username, access key,a and HubURL. You need to set them up as your environment variables. You can retrieve them from your [<BrandName /> automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/) by clicking on the key icon near the help button.

   - For Linux/Mac:
    ```
    $ export LT_USERNAME= {YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME}
    $ export LT_ACCESS_KEY= {YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY}
    ```
   - For Windows:

     ```
     $ set LT_USERNAME= {YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME}
     $ set LT_ACCESS_KEY= {YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY}
     ```

## Integrating Your <BrandName /> Account With AWS CodePipeline
***

**Step 1:** Login to your AWS CodePipeline instance. Visit the Pipelines page and create a new pipeline.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/aws-codePipeline-integration/aws-codepipeline1.webp').default} alt="AWS CodePipeline" width="1316" height="419" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 2:** Set your pipeline settings for a **new service role**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/aws-codePipeline-integration/aws-codepipeline2.webp').default} alt="AWS CodePipeline" width="1247" height="461" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** Now, provide your git details in the next step to **Add Source Stage**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/aws-codePipeline-integration/aws-codepipeline3.webp').default} alt="AWS CodePipeline" width="1209" height="460" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** Follow the steps in AWS CodePipeline & fill the form page on the next step to **Add build stage**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/aws-codePipeline-integration/aws-codepipeline4.webp').default} alt="AWS CodePipeline" width="1223" height="425" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 5:** Create a new build project while adding a **Build Stage**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/aws-codePipeline-integration/aws-codepipeline5.webp').default} alt="AWS CodePipeline" width="1025" height="410" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 6:**  Choose a **Deploy Provider** on **deploy stage** screen and click on **Next**.

<img loading="lazy" src={require('../assets/images/aws-codePipeline-integration/aws-codepipeline6.webp').default} alt="AWS CodePipeline" width="1160" height="393" className="doc_img"/>

>**Note:** Find the sample code from our [GitHub repository for AWS CodePipeline](https://github.com/LambdaTest/protractor-selenium-awscodepipeline-sample).

**Step 7:** Start a build and pull the codes from Git. Read the below `buildspec.yml` from your project’s root directory.

```
version: 0.2
env:
  variables:
    LT_USERNAME: "{your_lambda_username}"
    LT_ACCESS_KEY: "{your_lambda_access_key}"
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 10
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Installing source NPM dependencies...
      - npm install
      - npm install -g protractor
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - cd conf
      - protractor single.conf.js
artifacts:
  files:
      - '**/*'
  base-directory: 'dist*'
discard-paths: yes
```

**Step 8:** Monitor your test being triggered on the <BrandName /> platform. You will observe the below output generated.

```

Kudos! Now, you can rapidly commit changes and validate them for UI/UX anomalies by executing automated cross browser testing using <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. Happy Testing! 🙂
