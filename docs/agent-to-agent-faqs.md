Below are a few commonly asked questions about our Agent to Agent Testing platform:

#### 1. **Does Agent to Agent provide AI-enabled translation or multilingual analysis capabilities for testing?**

Yes. It supports AI-enabled multilingual requirement analysis, allowing teams to extract and analyze requirements from documents written in multiple languages. It generates test scenarios that account for multilingual support requirements defined in agent specifications and supports testing AI agents that handle multiple languages across interactions.

**Key capabilities include:**

- **Multilingual requirement extraction and analysis** from documents

- **AI-driven test scenario generation** aligned with multilingual support requirements

- **Support for analyzing AI agents** designed to operate across multiple languages

***

#### 2. **Does the platform support NLP, unstructured data, and metadata management for GenAI engineering?**

   Yes. It supports NLP-driven processing of unstructured data and metadata management, enabling extraction, analysis, and organization of information from documents, conversations, and datasets used in GenAI workflows.

***

#### 3. **Do they provide Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) refinement capabilities?**

   Yes. RAG refinement is supported, allowing teams to improve retrieval accuracy, optimize context selection, and enhance grounding data for more reliable and relevant GenAI outputs.

***
#### 4. **Does the platform support Large Language Model (LLM) refinement for GenAI applications?**

  Yes. LLM refinement is supported through evaluation-driven feedback, prompt optimization, and iterative workflows, boosting model accuracy, consistency, and task performance.

***

#### 5. **Do they offer AI model audit capabilities?**

    Yes, AI model audit capabilities is supported. It enables audit logging, evaluation traceability, and historical records to support transparency, compliance, and validation of GenAI model behavior.

***

#### 6. **Is model governance for GenAI systems supported?**

    Yes, model governance through controlled workflows, version tracking, access controls, audit trails, and policy-aligned oversight across GenAI model lifecycles is supported.

***

#### 7. **Does the platform help optimize GenAI architecture and system design?**

   Yes. The platform supports GenAI architecture optimization by enabling performance evaluation, cost monitoring, scalability analysis, and architectural decision validation across GenAI systems.

***

#### 8. **Does the platform support NLP, unstructured data processing, and metadata management for GenAI engineering?**

   Yes. The platform provides comprehensive NLP, unstructured data processing, and metadata management capabilities to support GenAI engineering workflows. It enables multi-modal document processing, advanced requirement extraction, natural language understanding, and metadata traceability across diverse data formats using multiple LLMs.

   **Key capabilities include:**

- **Multi-modal document processing** for text (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, MD), images (with OCR), audio (with speech-to-text), and video (with frame extraction and transcription)

- **Structured requirement extraction from unstructured data**, including entity extraction, business rules, integration points, and security requirements

- **NLP capabilities** such as natural language understanding, conversational AI testing, intent recognition, context memory testing, and multi-turn reasoning

- **Metadata management** with document and file metadata extraction, requirement relationship mapping, source requirement ID traceability, and cross-document linkage

- **Unstructured data processing** including OCR for images, speech-to-text for audio, video frame analysis, and semantic understanding across formats

***

#### 9. **How many data source connectors does the platform offer out of the box, and does it support third-party integrations for GenAI engineering?**

    The platform provides three native out-of-the-box (OOTB) data source connectors and supports additional integrations via third-party services and secure tunnel infrastructure. This enables secure access to both public and private data sources used in GenAI engineering workflows.

**Native OOTB connectors include:**

- **GitHub** for repository content extraction, README retrieval, and file access, with support for public and private repositories via secure tunnels

- **JIRA** for ticket retrieval, project information access, and issue tracking integration, including private JIRA instances via secure tunnels

- **Confluence** for page content import, documentation retrieval, and knowledge base integration, with support for private Confluence instances via secure tunnels
