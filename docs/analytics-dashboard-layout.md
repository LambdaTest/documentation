## Explaining the Features with Sample Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Organizing widgets based on priority

As a QA Manager, you may want to organize your dashboard to display high-priority widgets at the top. Using the widget management feature, you can easily drag and drop widgets to rearrange them based on priority, making it easier to access and analyze important information quickly.

### Use Case 2: Resizing widgets to optimize screen space

As a QA tester, you may have a variety of widgets displaying different types of data. Some widgets may require more screen space for better visibility. The widget management feature allows you to resize widgets, enabling you to allocate more screen space for critical data and less for less important information.

### Use Case 5: Optimizing dashboard for mobile devices

If you frequently access your dashboard on a mobile device, the widget management feature allows you to optimize the layout and size of widgets, ensuring that the dashboard is easily accessible and readable on a smaller screen.
