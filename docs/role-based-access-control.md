For every enterprise that uses cloud services, access management for those cloud resources is vital. <BrandName /> RBAC is an authorization system that allows seamless access management of <BrandName /> resources. With <BrandName /> role-based access control, you can control who has access to <BrandName /> resources, how they can leverage those resources, and what domains they can have access to.

The <BrandName /> RBAC will help you in creating the different teams and allot concurrency to those teams. In this way, you can perform the test automation by dividing the concurrency among the teams.
