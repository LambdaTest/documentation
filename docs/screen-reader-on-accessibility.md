A Screen Reader is an assistive technology tool that converts digital content on screens into audio output or Braille for users with visual impairments. More than a simple text-to-speech tool, it acts as a comprehensive digital interpreter, transforming complex visual interfaces into navigable auditory or tactile experiences. It helps users with visual disabilities to interact with digital content with unprecedented independence and depth.

## Why Do We Need Screen Readers?
Screen readers are essential for making digital environments accessible to visually impaired users. It helps to:

- **Enhance Inclusivity :** Users with visual disabilities can access and interact with websites, applications, and digital content.
- **Support Compliance :** Ensure adherence to accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and legal regulations such as ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) or Section 508.
- **Improve Usability :** Highlight areas where the user experience can be improved for all users, not just those with visual impairments.
- **Boost Engagement :** Make websites and applications more usable for a diverse audience, improving user satisfaction and reach.

## Screen Reader Support in LambdaTest Accessibility Testing
LambdaTest supports the following screen readers during Accessibility Testing:

- **NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access)** – Windows
- **VoiceOver** – macOS
- **TalkBack** – Android
> 📕 To learn more about using TalkBack for Android devices, refer to the [TalkBack Documentation](/support/docs/screen-reader-on-real-devices-app/).

These tools allow developers and testers to evaluate how well their applications or websites perform for visually impaired users, ensuring accessibility compliance and usability.
