## Purpose of Accessibility Scan

Accessibility scans ensure that websites are inclusive and usable for users with disabilities by identifying WCAG violations such as missing alt text, insufficient contrast, inaccessible form elements, and more.

These scans help:
* Meet legal compliance (ADA, WCAG 2.0/2.1)
* Improve usability for all users
* Reduce the burden of manual audits

### More options:
