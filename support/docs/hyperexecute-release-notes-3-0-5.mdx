## Feature: syncStart
HyperExecute now supports the `syncStart` directive in the job YAML. When enabled, all VMs in `autosplit` or `matrix` mode start their tasks simultaneously after allocation—ideal for benchmarking or comparative test runs.

If some VMs are not ready within 15 minutes, the job starts with the available ones.

> **NOTE :** For detailed usage and examples, refer to the detailed [HyperExecute documentation](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#syncstart).
