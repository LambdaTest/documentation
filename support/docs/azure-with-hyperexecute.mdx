Azure DevOps offers developer services that enable teams to plan their work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications. Azure DevOps fosters a collaborative culture and set of processes that bring together software developers, project managers, and contributors. It enables organizations to create and improve products at a much faster rate than traditional software development approaches allow.

This document will show you how to integrate Azure Devops Pipeline with HyperExecute to greatly shorten your test cycles.

## How To Integrate Azure DevOps Pipeline with Hyperexecute

***

To integrate Azure DevOps Pipeline with HyperExecute, follow the below steps: 

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Check>
**SAMPLE REPO**

Sample repo
Download or Clone the code sample from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

</Check>

### 1. Log into your Azure DevOps account

### 2. Create a New Project
 Go to the top-right corner of your Azure Devops profile page and click the **+ New Project** button.

Follow the prompts to successfully create a new project.

### 3. Create a New Pipeline

Next, you need to create a new pipeline. To create a new pipeline, click the **Pipelines** button from the left panel or from the main page.

### 4. Configure the Azure Pipeline YAML to Execute Hyperexecute CLI Binary:

To configure the Azure DevOps pipeline YAML to execute the HyperExecute CLI Binary, run the following command: 

```bash
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'  # Adjust for macOS if needed

steps:
  - task: Bash@3
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: |
        # Download Hyperexecute CLI for macOS (adjust for other OS)
        name: Download HyperExecute CLI
        script: wget https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
        
        # Grant execute permission to the downloaded binary
        name: Make HyperExecute executable
        script: chmod +x hyperexecute
        
        # Run Hyperexecute with user credentials and configuration file
        name: Run Hyperexecute Tests
        script: ./hyperexecute --user <your_username> --key <your_access_key> --config <your_yaml_file_path>
```

- **Trigger:** In the **trigger** section, state the branch of your your test repository that you would like to trigger.
Here, the **main** branch is selected as the test repository to commit the Azure Pipeline Yaml.
- **Pool:** In the **pool** section, state the OS flavor of the Virtual Machine Image that you would like to use.
- **Steps:** In the **steps** section, declare the flow of the pipeline execution. 
- **Script:** In the **script** section, state the command that you would like to execute in the following steps: 
    - Download a fresh version of the HyperExecute CLI binary
    - Execute the Hyperexecute CLI binary. (The Hyperexecute CLI binary contains LambdaTest username, access key and path   of the Yaml created for Hyperexecute. You can find more information on this [here.](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid))

<Note>
**Note**: Ensure that your username and access key for your LambdaTest account is visible in the script. 
</Note>

### 5. Run the Pipeline
To run the new pipeline that you just created, click the **Run** or **Save and Run** button at the top-right corner of the page.
