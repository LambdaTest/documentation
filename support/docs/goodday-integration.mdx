<Warning> GoodDay is a comprehensive work management platform that offers tools for project management, task organization, and productivity growth with features that boost transparency, agility, and motivation. With GoodDay as the bug tracking tool, project teams can easily avoid the hassle of digging through bug logs for hours. Bugs are a part of the software development process, which is unlikely to change. As software projects grow in features, their complexity also increases, which increases the number of bugs. The GoodDay bug tracker lets users capture, log, and prioritize the bugs that require fixing on priority. GoodDay integrates with the tools you use daily, letting you work faster and deliver more quality software on time. The GoodDay bug tracker template has a Kanban board to represent all the relevant information about each bug. It shows who is responsible for fixing the bug and when, so you can assign the bug to the person responsible. You can even set a deadline or schedule the task to have all the bugs resolved.</Warning> 

The Lambdatest GoodDay integration helps you in filing bug-related issues to your project in GoodDay directly from the Lambdatest platform. With one-click integration, you can push annotated bug issues to the project of your choice, assign them to the required teammate, and attach necessary screenshots. You can do all that while in the middle of a test session in the Lambdatest platform. The fields populated by you when marking as a bug through Lambdatest are displayed as information on the GoodDay platform for a testing instance.

<Warning> GoodDay Integration with Lambdatest, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plans.</Warning>

<Warning>
 **What is an API token?**
 What is an API token? When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.
</Warning>

**Step 5:** You can find your API token from your GoodDay account. If you have not generated one before, you can generate an API token by going to the settings. You will find the "Settings" icon on the top right corner of your dashboard.

**Step 6:** As you click on "Settings", you will see a section named "Integrations" on the left side navigation bar. Upon clicking "Integrations", you need to select "API" from the drop-down.

<Warning> You can keep a note of this API token with you for future authentication. Although, in case you forget to do so, or you end up neglecting it due to some reason. Then there is no need to panic! You can create a new token by defining a new label. You can also delete a previously declared API Key, in case you feel that your API Key has been placed in some wrong hands. You can delete an API Key by hovering over the label and clicking on the bin icon. </Warning>

**Step 8:** Copy the newly generated API token.
