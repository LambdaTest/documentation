Google Chat enables business teams to streamline their communications within Google Workspace. With Google Chat, you can chat using text, create collaborative chat rooms, share files, and hold virtual conferences.

<BrandName /> and Google Chat can be used to create test cards in Google Chats Spaces for logged bugs in <BrandName />. This will notify you every time a new bug is pushed while performing [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/) of websites.
