Learn how to use Playwright with Python to automate web application testing across 50+ real browsers and operating systems on <BrandName /> cloud platform.

## Prerequisites
***

1. You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Tip>
**Sample repo**

Download or clone the code sample for the Playwright Python from the <BrandName /> GitHub repository to run the tests.

<GitHubButton url="https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample/tree/main/playwright-python" />
</Tip>

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
cd playwright-python
```

2. Install the npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. A <BrandName /> Username and Access key. You can get it from your <BrandName /> Profile section. Don't have an account, [sign up for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).

4. To run Playwright tests, set your <BrandName /> Username and Access key in the Environment Variables.

## Run your Playwright tests with Python
---

Navigate to the `playwright_sample.py` file in the `playwright-python` directory.

```py
import json
import os
import urllib
import subprocess

from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

capabilities = {
    'browserName': 'Chrome',  # Browsers allowed: `Chrome`, `MicrosoftEdge`, `pw-chromium`, `pw-firefox` and `pw-webkit`
    'browserVersion': 'latest',
    'LT:Options': {
        'platform': 'Windows 10',
        'build': 'Playwright Python Build',
        'name': 'Playwright Python Test',
        'user': os.getenv('LT_USERNAME'),
        'accessKey': os.getenv('LT_ACCESS_KEY'),
        'network': True,
        'video': True,
        'console': True,
        'tunnel': False,  # Add tunnel configuration if testing locally hosted webpage
        'tunnelName': '',  # Optional
        'geoLocation': '', # country code can be fetched from https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/
    }
}

def run(playwright):
    playwrightVersion = str(subprocess.getoutput('playwright --version')).strip().split(" ")[1]
    capabilities['LT:Options']['playwrightClientVersion'] = playwrightVersion

    lt_cdp_url = 'wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=' + urllib.parse.quote(
        json.dumps(capabilities))
    browser = playwright.chromium.connect(lt_cdp_url)
    page = browser.new_page()
    try:
        page.goto("https://www.bing.com/")
        page.fill("[aria-label='Enter your search term'] > input", 'TestMu AI')
        page.keyboard.press("Enter")
        page.wait_for_timeout(1000)

        title = page.title()

        print("Title:: ", title)

        if "TestMu AI" in title:
            set_test_status(page, "passed", "Title matched")
        else:
            set_test_status(page, "failed", "Title did not match")
    except Exception as err:
        print("Error:: ", err)
        set_test_status(page, "failed", str(err))

    browser.close()

def set_test_status(page, status, remark):
    page.evaluate("_ => {}",
                  "lambdatest_action: {\"action\": \"setTestStatus\", \"arguments\": {\"status\":\"" + status + "\", \"remark\": \"" + remark + "\"}}");

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)

```

Pass the below command in the terminal to run the test.

```js
npm run test
```
