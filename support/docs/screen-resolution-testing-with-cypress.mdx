As part of a responsive design process, it is important to ensure that websites or web applications under test run properly on different screen sizes. 

<BrandName /> lets you test websites with Cypress across different screen resolutions on over 50+ browser versions on cloud.

Cypress provides website testing on different resolutions using

* Viewports
* Full Screen mode

## Test on Viewports
---

When you define a viewport, Cypress automatically uses the browser's scaling capabilities to customize the size of the web application. Therefore, on defining a large viewport, Cypress will scale down the web application. If you specify a small viewport, Cypress will upscale it.

To set the viewport's width and height globally, you need to define `viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight` in the Cypress configuration file.

**Syntax**

```js
cy.viewport(550, 750) // Set viewport to 550px x 750px
cy.viewport('iphone-6') // Set viewport to 375px x 667px
```
For more details, please check the [official Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport#Syntax).
## Test on Full Screen mode
---

<Tip>
**The use of full-screen mode in conjunction with viewports can help you achieve good results when performing screen resolution testing for web applications.**

</Tip>

To test your web applications in full screen mode, use the following event to change the browser options.

```js
before:browser:launch
```

For **Cypress v9 and below**, use the following script in the `plugin/index.js` file.

```js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on('before:browser:launch', (browser = {}, launchOptions) => {
    if (browser.family === 'chromium' && browser.name !== 'electron') {
      launchOptions.args.push('--start-fullscreen')
  
      return launchOptions
    }
  
    if (browser.name === 'electron') {
      launchOptions.preferences.fullscreen = true
  
      return launchOptions
    }
  })
}
```

For **Cypress v10 and above**, you can add the below code in `cypress.config.js` file.

```js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      on('before:browser:launch', (browser = {}, launchOptions) => {
        if (browser.family === 'chromium' && browser.name !== 'electron') {
          launchOptions.args.push('--start-fullscreen')
      
          return launchOptions
        }
      
        if (browser.name === 'electron') {
          launchOptions.preferences.fullscreen = true
      
          return launchOptions
        }
      })
    }
  }
})
```
