<BrandName />’s **Device Passcode** feature allows you to test applications that require a device passcode as part of their security or authentication flow.  
This is especially useful for apps in **Banking/Finance**, **Enterprise**, or those distributed via **MDM (Mobile Device Management)** that mandate passcode entry for sensitive workflows.

## Use Cases

- Verify app behavior when the device requires a passcode for login or secure actions.  
- Test app workflows that trigger a system passcode prompt (e.g., after inactivity, or accessing secure sections).  
- Validate app compliance with enterprise policies that enforce passcodes.  
- Reproduce real-world scenarios for apps with heightened security requirements.

### Android Devices
Available on **all real devices** running on **version 11 and above**.


## Default Passcode

- **Android:**  `1234`   

## Accessing Device Passcode in Manual Testing

**Step 1:** (**iOS only**) On the App Testing Dashboard, click **Advanced Settings** and enable the **Device Passcode** filter. This will refine the iOS device list to show only those with passcode support.

**Step 2:** Start a manual testing session on your selected device (iOS or Android).  
- On **iOS** → Open the **iOS Settings** panel and toggle **Passcode** on.

- On **Android** → Open the **Device Controls** panel and toggle **Passcode** on.

Setup may take **15–30 seconds** depending on the platform.

**Step 4:** Trigger the workflow inside your app that requires the device passcode.  
- A system passcode screen will appear.  
- Since passcode entry is sensitive, the keypad or the screen may not be streamed and could appear as black in your session view.  
- Use your system keyboard to enter the default passcode:  
  - iOS: `123456`  
  - Android: `1234`   

**Step 5:** Continue your app testing once the **passcode** is validated.


<Note>
**NOTE**

- Passcode input is **not visible** in the stream for security reasons.  
- You may experience a blacked-out screen briefly during passcode entry.
