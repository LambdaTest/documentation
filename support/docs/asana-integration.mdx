> Asana is a popular tool for teams following Agile methodology as a part of their Software Development Life Cycle. With Asana, you can coordinate all your team’s work by eliminating roadblocks and pinpointing risks. It offers a free flowing dashboard for sprint planning. Allowing everyone to acknowledge who is doing what and when! You can manipulate tasks freely from one state to another. You can also set out ambitious goals and create a path towards achieving it by different tasks displayed on the dashboard.

The <BrandName /> Asana Integration allows you to create a task directly to your specified Asana dashboard from <BrandName /> platform. Share your UI observations and input with your teammates anytime, by capturing a screenshot, even in the middle of your test session. You can annotate the screenshot & highlight your issue or input. The fields populated by you when marking as bug through <BrandName /> are displayed as information on Asana for that testing instance.

* **Why we ask for your login credentials?**

Asana APIs uses OAuth 2.0's [authorization code grant flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) for generating access tokens on user's behalf. It can also communicate with API from the command line with the help of Personal Access Token.

* **What is a Personal Access Token?**

In scenarios where OAuth is excessively utilized, Personal Access Tokens comes to aid in accessing the API. While generating a token, make sure you provide a description that is easy to remember, as your Personal Access Token will be derived from it. Treat this token just as you would treat your own password! Access tokens are strings with authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.
