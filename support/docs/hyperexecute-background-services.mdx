Background Services is a feature of HyperExecute which is generally used to run the long running **Application Servers**. You can trigger the background services by using either the `background` or `backgroundDirectives` property in the [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#background) file.

This feature is useful for the following cases:

- Web Applications or Servers.
- Running databases.
- Providing file sharing or streaming services.
- Running messaging or chat applications.
- Providing APIs for other applications to use.

## Enable Background Service
There are two methods to enable the **Background Service** from the HyperExecute YAML file:

### 1. Using `backgroundDirectives`

```yaml
backgroundDirectives:
  shell: bash
  commands:
    - name: YOUR_SERVICE_NAME
      command: npx static-server
    - name: Database
      command: mysql-server
```
- `shell`: defines the terminal it should use to run the background service.
- `command`: specifies the command to be executed in the background.
- `name`: specifies the name of your Background Service.

### 2. Using `background`

```yaml
background:
  - npx static-server
  - mysql-server
```
