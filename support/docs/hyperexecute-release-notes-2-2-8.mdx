- **Organized Test Management:** Easily group users and their corresponding tests based on specific projects, teams, or departments to keep your testing environment structured and efficient.

- **Improved Visibility and Control:** Administrators can now manage user access to specific test data, ensuring that sensitive or confidential tests are protected from unauthorized access.

- **Enhanced Team Collaboration:** This feature fosters better communication and knowledge sharing within teams, enabling a more integrated and informed testing process.
