## Step 2: Integrate the Slack with your <BrandName /> Account

- Click on the **Connect** button and then **Install** for the Slack integration.

<Note>
**NOTE :** If you are already logged into Slack, you'll be redirected to a page where you have to post to a channel to confirm your identity or else you will be asked to provide Slack URL of your workspace.
</Note>

- Select the channel you want to post on. Click on **Allow** button.

A notification would be shared on to all the members belonging to that channel, informing about your integration.

## Step 3: Update the Notification Settings and Trigger the Job

Once you integrate Slack, you need to configure notification settings to get test automation notifications on your integrated Slack channel.

- Go to your desired Project.
- Click on the **Project Settings** button.
- In the **Notifications** tab, toggle the slack alerts to true
- Click on the **Update Settings** button.
- Now again trigger the project with the changes and visit the Slack channel to view the notification containing meta information about the build.
