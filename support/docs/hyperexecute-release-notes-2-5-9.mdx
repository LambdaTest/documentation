## Consolidated JUnit XML Report Generation
The consolidated JUnit XML report includes detailed information on all executed tests, i.e., which tests passed, failed, or were skipped, along with any error messages and stack traces for failed tests. It is widely supported across CI/CD tools, which makes it easy to integrate with existing workflows and with other tools or systems.
<Note>
📕 Refer to our documentation for detailed instructions on setting up your project and using the new [JUnit XML report](/support/docs/junit-xml-report/)
