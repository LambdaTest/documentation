This article guides you on how to execute your **Cypress** tests including the **private dependencies** on **<BrandName /> platform**.
Earlier if your project includes any private dependency, the tests will error out with the **LambdaError** on our platform but now we have built the support for handling the private dependencies.

> In this demo we are demonstrating using [<BrandName />'s Sample Cypress Cloud Repo](https://github.com/<BrandName />/Cypress-Cloud). You can find all the resources used for this article in the linked repo.

## Steps To Execute Using Private Dependencies

---

Assuming that you have run a Cypress test on <BrandName /> platform ( if not, this article [here](/support/docs/getting-started-with-cypress-testing/) will guide you in running your first Cypress test on <BrandName />), you need to follow these steps below:

### Update <BrandName /> Cypress CLI

---

- Before getting started, you would have to update the **testmu ai-cypress cli** using the command below:

```bash
npm install -g testmu ai-cypress-cli
```

- The CLI version should be the latest i.e. is 2.3.0. You can check the CLI version by running the below command.

```bash
testmu ai-cypress --version
```

### Add Private Dependencies

---

You can either add private dependency in the `package.json` file or in the `testmu ai-config.json` file. Refer to the below steps for both approaches.

- **If passing private dependency in package.json file –**

  Add the private dependency and create `.npmrc` file in the root directory of your project as highlighted below and define the same in `.npmrc` file as well.

- **If passing private dependency in testmu ai-config.json file -**

  If you define the dependencies in the `testmu ai-config.json` file, it will override the `package.json` file and our cloud grid will read the dependencies from the `testmu ai-config.json` file. You can define the dependencies in the npm_dependencies object available in the run_settings of `testmu ai-config.json` file. Also, here as well, you have to create `.npmrc` file and there you have to define the private dependency.

  > If you are using an **access token** in the private dependency and you are accessing its value from the **environment variable**, in that case, you have to add `dep_token` capability and define all those in environment variables in it. You can pass multiple environment variables as comma-separated.

  Refer the below screenshot for the help.

  > All the keys present in **dep_tokens** will be replaced in the `.npmrc` file and if the key is not present in the environment variable, it will throw an error.

After doing this setup, run your tests on the **<BrandName /> platform** and now the test will execute perfectly with the **private dependencies**.
