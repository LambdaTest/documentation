This article guides you on how to execute your **Cypress** tests including the **private dependencies** on **LambdaTest platform**.
Earlier if your project includes any private dependency, the tests will error out with the **LambdaError** on our platform but now we have built the support for handling the private dependencies.

<Warning>

In this demo we are demonstrating using [LambdaTest's Sample Cypress Cloud Repo](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Cypress-Cloud). You can find all the resources used for this article in the linked repo.

## Steps To Execute Using Private Dependencies

Assuming that you have run a Cypress test on lambdatest platform ( if not, this article [here](/support/docs/getting-started-with-cypress-testing/) will guide you in running your first Cypress test on LambdaTest), you need to follow these steps below:

### Update LambdaTest Cypress CLI

- Before getting started, you would have to update the **lambdatest-cypress cli** using the command below:

```bash
npm install -g lambdatest-cypress-cli
```

- The CLI version should be the latest i.e. is 2.3.0. You can check the CLI version by running the below command.

```bash
lambdatest-cypress --version
```

### Add Private Dependencies

You can either add private dependency in the `package.json` file or in the `lambdatest-config.json` file. Refer to the below steps for both approaches.

- **If passing private dependency in package.json file –**

  Add the private dependency and create `.npmrc` file in the root directory of your project as highlighted below and define the same in `.npmrc` file as well.

- **If passing private dependency in lambdatest-config.json file -**

  If you define the dependencies in the `lambdatest-config.json` file, it will override the `package.json` file and our cloud grid will read the dependencies from the `lambdatest-config.json` file. You can define the dependencies in the npm_dependencies object available in the run_settings of `lambdatest-config.json` file. Also, here as well, you have to create `.npmrc` file and there you have to define the private dependency.

  <img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/dependencies/dependencies-4.webp' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" className="doc_img"/>

  <Warning>
  If you are using an **access token** in the private dependency and you are accessing its value from the **environment variable**, in that case, you have to add `dep_token` capability and define all those in environment variables in it. You can pass multiple environment variables as comma-separated.
  </Warning>

  Refer the below screenshot for the help.

  <Warning>
  All the keys present in **dep_tokens** will be replaced in the `.npmrc` file and if the key is not present in the environment variable, it will throw an error.
  </Warning>

After doing this setup, run your tests on the **LambdaTest platform** and now the test will execute perfectly with the **private dependencies**.

<Warning>
To download private dependencies over tunnel follow this [documentation](/support/docs/npm-via-tunnel/).
