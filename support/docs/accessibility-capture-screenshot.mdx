Automatically capture visual evidence of accessibility issues during automated testing. Screenshots include red bounding boxes that highlight the exact location of accessibility violations, providing immediate visual context for debugging and issue resolution.

## Enable Capture Screenshot

### Manual Testing

---

1. Navigate to **Accessibility Tool** → **Settings** → **Other Settings**
2. Enable **Capture Screenshots**
3. Run your accessibility scan to capture annotated screenshots
   <img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/accessibility-testing/features/accessibility-capture-screenshot.png' alt="Accessibility Passed Test Cases" style={{ width: "650px", height: "auto"}} />

### Automation Testing

---

Add the `accessibility.captureScreenshot: true` capability to your test configuration:

```javascript
'LT:Options': {
    "accessibility": true,
    "accessibility.wcagversion": "wcag21aa",
    "accessibility.bestPractice": true,
    "accessibility.needsReview": false,
    "accessibility.captureScreenshot": true,
    "accessibility.passedTestCases": false
}
```

### Visual Annotations

<Note>
This feature is available across all supported testing frameworks and in Accessibility Devtools
