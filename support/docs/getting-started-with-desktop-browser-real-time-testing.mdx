## Understanding the Dashboard
The dashboard for real-time desktop browser testing is designed to simplify the testing process with an intuitive user interface. Here’s a breakdown of its key components:

- **Operating System Selection Panel :** Choose from different OS versions of Windows and macOS, such as Windows 11, Windows 10..., macOS Sequoia, macOS Sonoma, macOS Ventura,... Each selection expands to show supported versions.

- **Browser and its Version Selection Panel :** Lists the available web browsers and their corresponding versions. Versions are displayed with release dates for easy reference. Clicking on a browser filters the versions available for the selected OS.

- **Screen Resolution Options :** Shows the available resolutions for the selected browser version. This allows you to test responsive design scenarios and see how your application behaves across various screen sizes.

- **URL Input Field :** Enter the URL of your web application which you want to test in the real time console of <BrandName />.

### Additional Options
- The top panel contains advanced settings, including the ability to enable a [Tunnel](/support/docs/real-time-locally-hosted-pages/) for testing internal or locally hosted applications, as well as a toggle for Private Cloud access if applicable.
- [Chrome Extensions](/support/docs/pre-loaded-chrome-extension/) dropdown allows for adding extensions during a test session, making it suitable for testing add-on functionalities.
- The Start button triggers the virtual machine with the chosen settings.

These features provide flexibility for comprehensive browser testing, making it easier to identify issues and ensure a consistent user experience across different configurations.
