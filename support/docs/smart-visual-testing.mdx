## Upload Baseline

Once you login, click on the Navigation menu bar in the left *Visual UI Testing > Smart Testing*.

Next, we have to upload a Baseline image

**Step 1:** Upload a baseline image. Click on the + icon next to the Base Line Images header.

This will take you to a new window with a comparison image. You can zoom-in or Zoom out the images in this window, change the image difference color, switch to slider mode, switch to side-by-side mode, or mark the image as a bug.

## Side by Side Mode

There are multiple options for you to view your images. The side by side mode will open all three images, baseline image, comparison image, and comparison result image in a single window. In this mode, you can also mark the image as a bug. Or you can switch to any other mode.

## Slider Mode

In slider mode, you can view the baseline image and comparison image overlapped over each other and toggle them with a slider. This mode can help you view the difference between the two images very easily.
