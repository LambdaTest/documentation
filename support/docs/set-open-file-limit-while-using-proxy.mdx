If you are using a tunnel service with <BrandName /> for cross browser testing then you may get the following warning.

*File descriptor limit is too low! Increase your limit to at least 2000.*

This warning is sent across to help you avoid a lack of available file handles. If this warning is ignored for a long time then you might have issues connecting your tunnel with <BrandName />. This would also be reflected in the <BrandName /> logs if you fail to connect your tunnel with <BrandName />. The logs would be reflecting the below error message.

*accept tcp 127.0.0.1:9090: accept: too many open files.*

We recommend that you expand the open file limit to 2000 for a seamless browser testing experience.

> Note: If your system is capable of handling a higher limit then please feel free to set the limit above 2000. However, 2000 is the minimum recommendation.

**Step 2**: Next, we need to verify if the setting are modified by running the below command.

`ulimit -n`

**Step 3**: Restart the tunnel and you’re ready to go!

### Increasing The Open File Limit Permanently

* * *

**Step 1**: You would have to edit the profile settings and set the file limit in the your `.profile` or `.bashrc` file. Add the below command in your `.profile` or `.bashrc` file.

`ulimit -SHn 2000`

**Step 2**: Execute `source ~/.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` or the profile you're using.

**Step 3**: Run the command `ulimit -n` to verify if the setting are modified.

**Step 4**: Restart the tunnel and you're ready to go!
