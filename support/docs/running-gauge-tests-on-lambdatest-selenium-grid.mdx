## Prerequisites

---

Before you can start performing Java automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment**. We recommend to use **Java 11** version.

- Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of Selenium Client and WebDriver are ideal for running your automation script on LambdaTest Selenium cloud grid.

- Install **Maven**. It can be downloaded and installed following the steps from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven can also be installed easily on **Linux/MacOS** using [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

- Install the **Gauge** framework which can be downloaded from [the official website of Gauge](https://docs.gauge.org/getting_started/installing-gauge.html?os=windows&language=null&ide=null).

### Cloning Repo and Installing Dependencies

**Step 1:** Clone the LambdaTest’s [gauge-selenium-sample](https://github.com/LambdaTest/gauge-selenium-sample) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/gauge-selenium-sample
cd gauge-selenium-sample
```

You may also want to run the command below to check for outdated dependencies.

```bash
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
```

**Step 2:** Install the mandatory Selenium dependencies for Maven by running the below command:

```bash
mvn compile
```

### Setting up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 3:** Set LambdaTest **Username** and **Access Key** in environment variables.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
    ```bash
    export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
    export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
    set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Run Your First Test

---

### Sample Test with Gauge

Let’s checkout sample Gauge code running LambdaTest Selenium grid.

```java StepImplementation_ToDo.java
package driver.driver;

import com.thoughtworks.gauge.Step;
import driver.driver.DriverFactory;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;

import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class StepImplementation_ToDo {

    private final WebDriver driver;

    public StepImplementation_ToDo() {
        this.driver = DriverFactory.getDriver();
    }

  @Step("Open the todo app")
  public void gotoApp() throws InterruptedException {

        System.out.println(DriverFactory.getDriver());
        driver.get("https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/");
        String title = driver.getTitle();
        assertEquals(title,"Sample page - lambdatest.com");
  }

  @Step("Select the desired items")
  public void selectItems() throws InterruptedException {

      WebElement itemOne = driver.findElement(By.name("li1"));
      itemOne.click();

      driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

      WebElement itemThird = driver.findElement(By.name("li3"));
      itemThird.click();
  }

  @Step("Add new item <itemName>")
  public void addNewItem(String itemName) throws InterruptedException {

      WebElement addItem  = driver.findElement(By.id("sampletodotext"));
      addItem.sendKeys(itemName);
      Thread.sleep(2000);

      WebElement addButton = driver.findElement(By.id("addbutton"));
      addButton.click();
  }
}
```

### Configuring your Test Capabilities

**Step 4:** In the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:

```java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("browserName", "chrome");
        capabilities.setCapability("version", "70.0");
        capabilities.setCapability("platform", "win10"); // If this cap isn't specified, it will just get the any available one
        capabilities.setCapability("build", "LambdaTestSampleApp");
        capabilities.setCapability("name", "LambdaTestJavaSample");
        capabilities.setCapability("network", true); // To enable network logs
        capabilities.setCapability("visual", true); // To enable step by step screenshot
        capabilities.setCapability("video", true); // To enable video recording
        capabilities.setCapability("console", true); // To capture console logs
```

<Note>
**NOTE**

You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator Tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.
</Note>

### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** The tests can be executed in the terminal using either of the following commands:

```bash
mvn test
```

or

```bash
mvn clean install
```

<Note>
**INFO**

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build). LambdaTest Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.
</Note>

## Run Parallel Tests using Gauge

---

Gauge framework do support parallel test execution on the LambdaTest grid. To perform parallel testing, more than one browser specifications need to be updated in the env folder of the project. For instance, we have defined specifications for Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge in the below screenshot. Once the test is executed, all parallel browser specifications will hit on the LambdaTest grid and execute simultaneously to achieve parallelism.

<Frame>
  <img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/selenium/gauge1.png" alt="cmd" width="768" height="373" className="doc_img"/>
</Frame>

In case you’d need to chuck out test for any browser, you would need to either delete the folder or comment out the code in it.

### Executing Parallel Tests Using Gauge

To run parallel tests using **Gauge**, we would have to execute the same command we had used for single test which would be:

```bash
mvn test  
```

or

```bash
mvn clean install
```

<Note>
**INFO**

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build).
</Note>

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

---

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

<Check>
**TUNNEL HELP**

Refer our 🔗 [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.
</Check>

Here’s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

<Note>
**DOWNLOAD THE BINARY FILE**

- [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
- [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
- [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)
</Note>

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
./LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```

So if your user name is **lambdatest@example.com**, the command would be:

```bash
./LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```

Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code as shown:

```java Tunnel Capability
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("tunnel", true);
```
