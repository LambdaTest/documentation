- **Faster Feedback on HyperExecute Jobs:** By streamlining test runs, Test Muting accelerates the feedback cycle on HyperExecute jobs, enabling testers to identify and address issues promptly.

- **Customizable Threshold Number to Mute Tests:** Users can tailor Test Muting to their specific needs by setting a custom threshold for automatically muting tests based on consecutive failures.

- **Manual Mute/Unmute of Specific Test Cases:** Users retain complete control over Test Muting, with the ability to manually mute or unmute specific test cases as needed.
