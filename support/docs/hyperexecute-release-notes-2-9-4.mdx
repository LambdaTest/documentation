## YAML-Based Capability Overrides for Selenium Tests
You can now override Selenium capabilities directly from your `hyperexecute.yaml` file using the new `ltOptions` flag. This enhancement allows you to define key-value pairs—like browser type, version, logs, video, tunnel, and more without changing your test scripts.

### Why it matters?
- Avoid code changes for environment-specific needs.
- Reuse the same script across different setups.
- Keep test code clean and capability-agnostic.

```yaml hyperexecute.yaml
ltOptions:
  browserName: firefox
  build: 'testng_build_yaml_ltOptions'
  console: true
  name: 'testng_test_yaml_ltOptions'
  network: true
  selenium_version: 4.20.0
  tunnel: false
  version: latest
  video: false
```

> 📘 Refer to our detailed documentation for [`ltOptions`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-capability-overrides/) flag.

## Network Logs & Tunnel Support for Maestro Framework
HyperExecute now supports `network logs` and `tunnel` capabilities for Maestro tests running on both virtual devices and real devices using the Raw Framework configuration.

### Feature Highlights
- **Network Logs:** Capture detailed request/response data during test execution for enhanced debugging and visibility.
- **Tunnel Support:** Access internal or staging environments securely using <BrandName /> Tunnel.
