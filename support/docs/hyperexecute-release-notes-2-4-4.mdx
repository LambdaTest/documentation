## HyperExecute now integrates with k6

HyperExecute now supports k6, a powerful open-source performance testing tool. HyperExecute supports all versions of k6 (till 0.52). To use any particular version, all you have to do is mention that specific version in the [runson flag](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#runson) in your [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/) file.

```yaml
runtime:
    addons:
      - name: k6
        version: "v0.52.0"
```

Also, add these environment variables in your YAML file to install the necessary dependencies for your tests

```yaml
env: 
  K6_BROWSER_ENABLED: true  
  K6_BROWSER_HEADLESS: false 
  HE_CONTEXT_K6_SETUP_DEFAULT_BROWSER_PATH: true
```

📕 Check the [k6 integration documentation](/support/docs/hyperexecute-k6-testing/) to learn more about it.
