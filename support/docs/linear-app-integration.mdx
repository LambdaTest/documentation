3. You will be asked to enter your Linear App **API Token**.

- **What is an API Token?**<br/>
  An API token is needed to validate a user's identity from one server to another by retrieving client resources from the server where the connection is made. API tokens are essential when an end user interacts to an application via a two-step verification process to ensure its security and data integrity.
