In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your Java automation testing scripts on [<BrandName /> Selenium cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using **Java** framework **Geb**.

## Objective

---

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **Geb** framework with **Selenium**.
2. Understand and configure the core capabilities required for your Selenium test suite.
3. Run test cases in parallel using **Geb** with Selenium to reduce build times.
4. Test your locally hosted pages on <BrandName /> platform.
5. Explore advanced features of <BrandName />.

<Tip>
**Sample repo**

All the code samples in this documentation can be found on **<BrandName />'s Github Repository**. You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests. <GitHubButton url="https://github.com/LambdaTest/geb-parallel-sample-code" />

</Tip>

## Prerequisites

---

Before you can start performing Java automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment**. We recommend to use **Java 11** version.

- Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of Selenium Client and WebDriver are ideal for running your automation script on <BrandName /> Selenium cloud grid.

- Install **Maven**. It can be downloaded and installed following the steps from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven can also be installed easily on **Linux/MacOS** using [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

### Cloning Repo and Installing Dependencies

**Step 1:** Clone the <BrandName />’s [geb-parallel-sample-code repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/geb-parallel-sample-code) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/geb-parallel-sample-code
cd geb-parallel-sample-code
```

**Step 2:** Compile Maven dependencies using the below command:

```bash
mvn compile
```

You may also want to run the command below to check for outdated dependencies.

```bash
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
```

### Setting up your Authentication

Make sure you have your <BrandName /> credentials with you to run test automation scripts on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [<BrandName /> Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [<BrandName /> Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 3:** Set <BrandName /> **Username** and **Access Key** in environment variables.

  ```bash

  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME" \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
  
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">

  ```powershell

  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME" \`
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
  
```

</Tab>

## Run Your First Test

### Configuring your Test Capabilities

**Step 4:** In `capabilities.json` file, you need to update your test capabilities. Here, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with <BrandName /> Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:

```json title="capabilities.json"
{
  "build": "GebFirstTest",
  "platform": "Windows 8",
  "browserName": "Mozilla",
  "version": "65.0"
}
```

<Info>
You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt 🔗 **<a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/">Capabilities Generator Tool</a>**.

</Info>

### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** The tests can be executed in the terminal from the root of the project using the following commands:

```bash
./run.sh
```bash
mvn -Dlambdageb.capabilities=capabilities clean test
```

<Info>
**Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [TestMu AI automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build). TestMu AI Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.**

</Info>

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [TestMu AI Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using TestMu AI Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using TestMu AI Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. TestMu AI Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

<Tip>
**Tunnel Help**

Refer our 🔗 [TestMu AI Tunnel documentation](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

</Tip>

Here’s how you can establish TestMu AI Tunnel.

<Info>
**Download the binary file**

- [TestMu AI Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
- [TestMu AI Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
- [TestMu AI Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

</Info>

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
./LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```

So if your user name is **testmu ai@example.com**, the command would be:

```bash

  ./LT -user testmu ai@example.com -key YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
  
```

Once you are able to connect **TestMu AI Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code as shown:

```json title="Tunnel Capability"
"tunnel": true,
```
