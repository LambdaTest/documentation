Workflow Scan allows you to record multiple real-time interactions and page loads within a user journey on a website and then analyze them for accessibility issues. This helps ensure that users with disabilities can easily navigate and interact with your website across different scenarios.

## Functionalities of Workflow Scan:

- **Identify real-world accessibility issues :** Goes beyond static page analysis and identifies problems users might encounter during interaction.
- **Test complex user flows :** Ensures accessibility throughout navigation, forms, and interactive elements.
- **Save time and effort :** Tests multiple pages at once without needing individual scans.
- **Prioritize issues based on usage :** Focuses on problems encountered in typical user journeys.
