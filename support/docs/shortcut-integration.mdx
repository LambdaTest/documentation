The Lambdatest Shortcut integration helps you in filing issues to your project in Shortcut directly from Lambdatest platform. With one-click integration, you can push annotated issues to the project of your choice, assign it to the required teammate, and attach necessary screenshots. You can do all that while in the middle of a test session in Lambdatest platform. The fields populated by you when marking as a bug through Lambdatest are displayed as information on the Shortcut for a testing instance.

<Warning>
Shortcut Integration with Lambdatest, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.

## How To Establish Integration With Shortcut From Your Lambdatest Account?
***
**Step 1:** Login to your Lambdatest account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integrations’ from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your Lambdatest account.

<Warning>
**What is an API token?**
</Warning>
When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.

**Step 5:** You can find your API token from your Shortcut account. If you have not generated one before, you can generate an API token by going to the settings. Hit the Profile avatar icon on the bottom left and select ‘Settings’.

<Warning>
You can keep a note of this API token with you for future authentication. Although, in case you forget to do so, or you end up neglecting it due to some reason. Then there is no need to panic! You can create a new token by defining a new label. You can also delete a previously declared API Key, in case you feel that your API Key has been placed in some wrong hands. You can delete an API Key by hovering over the label and clicking on the bin icon.
</Warning>

**Step 8:** Your API token will be derived from the value you provided as an input. Copy your API Token.
