**Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** enhances account security by adding an extra layer of verification during the login process. In addition to the password, users are required to provide additional information or perform another authentication step. This additional factor, such as a fingerprint scan, SMS code, or biometric verification, significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, especially in the event of a compromised password. MFA is an effective security measure that strengthens account protection and safeguards user data.

## Enable User MFA

**Step 1:** Sign in to your <BrandName /> account. Don't have an account, [register for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).
