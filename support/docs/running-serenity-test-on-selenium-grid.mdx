</Tip>

## Prerequisites

---

Before you can start performing Java automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment**. We recommend to use **Java 11** version.

- Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of Selenium Client and WebDriver are ideal for running your automation script on <BrandName /> Selenium cloud grid.

- Install **Maven**. It can be downloaded and installed following the steps from [the official website](https://maven.apache.org/). Maven can also be installed easily on **Linux/MacOS** using [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

### Cloning Repo and Installing Dependencies

**Step 1:** Clone the <BrandName />’s [Serenity-Selenium-Sample](https://github.com/<BrandName />/Serenity-Selenium-Sample) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TestMu AI/Serenity-Selenium-Sample
cd Serenity-Selenium-Sample
```

You may also want to run the command below to check for outdated dependencies.

```bash
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
```

### Setting up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your <BrandName /> credentials with you to run test automation scripts on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [<BrandName /> Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [<BrandName /> Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 2:** Set <BrandName /> **Username** and **Access Key** in environment variables.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<Tab title="Linux / MacOS">

  ```bash

  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">

  ```powershell

  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \`
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Run Your First Test

---

### Sample Test with Serenity

To run your first Serenity Test on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid, let’s understand our test case scenario, the test case below checks for the word "**<BrandName />**" on Google and tests if the title of the resultant page is "**<BrandName />-Google Search**".

```bash
Feature: Google's Search Functionality
    Scenario: Can find search results
        When I type query as "TestMu AI"
        And I submit
        Then I should see title "TestMu AI - Google Search"
```

Following below is the `GooglePage.java` file for the above Test Case Scenario.

```java title="GooglePage.java"
package com.testmu ai.cucumber.pages;

import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

import org.openqa.selenium.support.FindBy;

import net.serenitybdd.core.pages.WebElementFacade;
import net.thucydides.core.annotations.DefaultUrl;
import net.thucydides.core.pages.PageObject;

@DefaultUrl("https://www.google.com/ncr")
public class GooglePage extends PageObject {

    @FindBy(name = "q")
    WebElementFacade search;

    @FindBy(name = "btnK")
    WebElementFacade searchButton;

    public void searchForString(String searchString) {
        search.sendKeys(searchString);
    }
 public void submitForm() throws Exception {
        searchButton.click();
        Thread.sleep(5000);
    }

    public void titleShouldMatch(String matchTitle) {
        assertThat(this.getTitle()).containsIgnoringCase(matchTitle);
    }
}
```

Below is the `TestMu AISerenityDriver.java` file that shows the integration of Serenity with <BrandName />.

```java title="LambdaTestSerenityDriver.java"
package com.testmu ai;

import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Iterator;

import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver;

import net.thucydides.core.util.EnvironmentVariables;
import net.thucydides.core.util.SystemEnvironmentVariables;
import net.thucydides.core.webdriver.DriverSource;

public class LambdaTestSerenityDriver implements DriverSource {

    public WebDriver newDriver() {
        EnvironmentVariables environmentVariables = SystemEnvironmentVariables.createEnvironmentVariables();

        String username = System.getenv("LT_USERNAME");
        if (username == null) {
            username = (String) environmentVariables.getProperty("lt.user");
        }

        String accessKey = System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY");
        if (accessKey == null) {
            accessKey = (String) environmentVariables.getProperty("lt.key");
        }

        String environment = System.getProperty("environment");
                DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("plugin","Serenity TestMu AI Plugin");

        Iterator it = environmentVariables.getKeys().iterator();
        while (it.hasNext()) {
            String key = (String) it.next();

            if (key.equals("lt.user") || key.equals("lt.key") || key.equals("lt.grid")) {
                continue;
            } else if (key.startsWith("lt_")) {
                capabilities.setCapability(key.replace("lt_", ""), environmentVariables.getProperty(key));

            } else if (environment != null && key.startsWith("environment." + environment)) {

                capabilities.setCapability(key.replace("environment." + environment + ".", ""),
                        environmentVariables.getProperty(key));
            }
        }

        try {
            String url = "https://" + username + ":" + accessKey + "@" + environmentVariables.getProperty("lt.grid")
                    + "/wd/hub";
            return new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(url), capabilities);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e);
            return null;
        }
    }

    public boolean takesScreenshots() {
        return false;
    }
}
```

<Info>
**Note**

You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt :link: **<a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/">Capabilities Generator Tool</a>**.

### Executing the Test

**Step 3:** The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command:

```bash
mvn verify -P single
```

<Info>
**Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [<BrandName /> automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build). <BrandName /> Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.**

## Run Your Parallel Test Using Serenity

---

### Setting up the Parallel Environment

To run parallel tests with Serenity, we will run **single.feature** test case in four different environments Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Safari.

```java title="ParallelChromeTest.java"
//Running Parallel Test On Chrome

@RunWith(CucumberWithSerenity.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = "src/test/resources/features/single.feature")
public class ParallelChromeTest extends LambdaTestSerenityTest {
}
```

Similarly we define the class for the remaining browsers.

### Executing Parallel Tests Using Serenity

To run parallel tests using Serenity, we would have to execute the below commands in the terminal:

```bash
mvn verify -P parallel
```

<Info>
**Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [<BrandName /> automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build).**

</Info>

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

---

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [<BrandName /> Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using <BrandName /> Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using <BrandName /> Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. <BrandName /> Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

<Tip>
**Tunnel Help**

Refer our :link: [<BrandName /> Tunnel documentation](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

</Tip>

Here’s how you can establish <BrandName /> Tunnel.

<Info>
**Download the binary file**

- [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
- [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
- [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

</Info>

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
./LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```

So if your user name is **testmu ai@example.com**, the command would be:

```bash

  {`./LT -user testmu ai@example.com -key ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}
  
```

Once you are able to connect **<BrandName /> Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code as shown:

```java title="Tunnel Capability"
tunnel = true
```

### Executing Local Tests Using Serenity

To run local tests using Serenity, we would have to execute the below commands in the terminal:

```bash
mvn verify -P local
```
