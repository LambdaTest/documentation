## Steps To Integrate <BrandName /> With Cypress Dashboard

---

Assuming that you have run a Cypress test on <BrandName /> platform ( if not, this article [here](/support/docs/getting-started-with-cypress-testing/) will guide you in running your first Cypress test on <BrandName />), you need to follow these steps below:

### Update <BrandName /> Cypress CLI

---

- Before getting started, you would have to update the **testmu ai-cypress cli** using the command below:

```bash
npm install -g testmu ai-cypress-cli
```

- The CLI version should be the latest i.e. is 2.3.0. You can check the CLI version by running the below command.

```bash
testmu ai-cypress --version
```

### Create a project

---

Create a project on Cypress Dashboard as shown below:

### Enter Project Name

---

### Define project ID

---

Once to create the project on Cypress Dashboard, you will get a `project ID` and a `record key`. Define the **project ID** in the `cypress.json` file of your project.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress-integration/cypress-integration-3.webp' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" />

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress-integration/cypress-integration-4.webp' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" />

### Define Record Key

---

Define the record key (Generated by Cypress Dashboard) in the run command as mentioned below:

```bash
testmu ai-cypress run --cy="--record;--key <key_value>"
```

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress-integration/cypress-integration-5.webp' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" />

### <BrandName />-Cypress Integration

---

The integration is now done, just open the **<BrandName /> Dashboard** and **Cypress Dashboard** to view the results.
