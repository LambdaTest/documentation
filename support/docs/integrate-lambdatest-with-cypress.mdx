## Steps To Integrate LambdaTest With Cypress Dashboard

Assuming that you have run a Cypress test on lambdatest platform ( if not, this article [here](/support/docs/getting-started-with-cypress-testing/) will guide you in running your first Cypress test on LambdaTest), you need to follow these steps below:

### Update LambdaTest Cypress CLI

- Before getting started, you would have to update the **lambdatest-cypress cli** using the command below:

```bash
npm install -g lambdatest-cypress-cli
```

- The CLI version should be the latest i.e. is 2.3.0. You can check the CLI version by running the below command.

```bash
lambdatest-cypress --version
```

### Create a project

Create a project on Cypress Dashboard as shown below:

### Enter Project Name

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress-integration/cypress-integration-2.webp' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" className="doc_img"/>

### Define project ID

Once to create the project on Cypress Dashboard, you will get a `project ID` and a `record key`. Define the **project ID** in the `cypress.json` file of your project.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress-integration/cypress-integration-3.webp' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" className="doc_img"/>

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress-integration/cypress-integration-4.webp' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" className="doc_img"/>

### Define Record Key

Define the record key (Generated by Cypress Dashboard) in the run command as mentioned below:

```bash
lambdatest-cypress run --cy="--record;--key <key_value>"
```

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress-integration/cypress-integration-5.webp' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" className="doc_img"/>

### LambdaTest-Cypress Integration

The integration is now done, just open the **LambdaTest Dashboard** and **Cypress Dashboard** to view the results.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress-integration/cypress-integration-7.webp' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" className="doc_img"/>
