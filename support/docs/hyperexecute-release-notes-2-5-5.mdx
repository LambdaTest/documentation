## Extended Report Formats for JUnit Framework
In addition to the existing JUnit XML report, support for generating reports in multiple formats (e.g., HTML, XML, JSON) has been added. This enhancement enables more flexible report generation to meet different user needs.

- **type:** xml
- **location:** Specify the directory where the reports will be generated.

```yaml
