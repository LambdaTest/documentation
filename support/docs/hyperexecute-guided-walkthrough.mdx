This page gives you a guided walkthrough of all the things on the HyperExecute Dashboard and how you can get the most out of the platform once you have successfully [run your first sample Job](/support/docs/hyperexecute-running-your-first-job/). 

## Jobs Page

All the tests on HyperExecute get executed as a Job. All the Jobs can be found on our [Jobs page](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute). Each [Job](/support/docs/hyperexecute-status/#1-job-level-status) has a [`Status`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-status/#3-stage-level-status), a unique `Job Number`, a set of [`Labels`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#joblabel), info on number of [`Tasks`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-status/#2-task-level-status) executed as part of that Job, and a `Summary` section followed by the details of the `Job Duration` and who initiated the Job.

On this page you have other things such as filters, help center, docs, [secrets management](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-save-and-manage-secrets/) and much more. You can also filter through all of the jobs on the basis of the date, status, type etc.

## Test Summary Hyperlink

This introduces clickable links within your **test summary**. When you click on these hyperlinks, it dynamically redirects you to the automation dashboard, providing immediate access to detailed test information corresponding to the specific test status clicked.

Additionally, upon redirection, the automation dashboard opens the relevant tab that aligns with the selected test status, streamlining your experience.

### How to Activate Test Summary Hyperlinks

- #### Update your Org Configuration :

<video controls className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" src="/assets/videos/hyperexecute/getting-started/guided-walkthrough/test-summary.mp4">
</video>

- #### Frontend Configuration :

  <Note> For frontend activation, please contact us via our <span className="doc__lt" onClick={() => window.openLTChatWidget()}>**24×7 chat support**</span> or you can also drop a mail to **support@lambdatest.com**.</Note><br />

- #### Backend Configuration :

  Update your designated HyperExecute YAML file with [`buildConfig`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#buildconfig) configuration to activate the "**Test Summary Hyperlink**" feature. This configuration allows you to define specific parameters that govern the behavior of the hyperlinks based on the test summary status.
