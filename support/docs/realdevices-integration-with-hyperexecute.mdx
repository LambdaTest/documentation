# Real Devices Integration with HyperExecute

Till now you have executed your test scripts on the [Real Device Automation](/support/docs/appium-python-pytest/). This Document will not only explain to you about how to use Real Devices on HyperExecute but also the superpower you just unlocked with HyperExecute - Test Orchestration and Intelligence.

HyperExecute is a smart test orchestration platform to run end-to-end tests at the fastest speed possible. HyperExecute lets you achieve an accelerated time to market by providing a test infrastructure that offers optimal speed, test orchestration, and detailed execution logs.

**Let's first take a look at the different ways of executing tests on HyperExecute:**

## 1. Triggering a job on HyperExecute  
In order to trigger a job on HyperExecute, it requires the [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) and a set of instructions inside the [HyperExecute Yaml](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/) file. When you trigger the CLI command, it connects with the HyperExecute APIs which then distributes the tests across different machines/nodes for parallel execution as shown in the diagram below:

## 2. Real Devices Test Execution on HyperExecute
In case of Real devices test execution the test scripts from the machines run the actual tests on connected real devices as shown in the diagram below:

## 3. Triggering through local machine
When you are triggering your test cases from the local machine the flow of data is as shown in the diagram below:

## 4. Triggering through Jenkins
In order to execute a job on HyperExecute via Jenkins, you would need to perform 2 simple steps :

You can read more about it [here](/support/docs/hyperexecute-integration-with-ci-cd-tools/).  When you want the job to be initiated from the Jenkins Pipeline, it would look as shown in the diagram below:
