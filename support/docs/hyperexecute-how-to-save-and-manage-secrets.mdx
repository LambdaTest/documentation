Testing your webapp or applications often involves using the sensitive data like passwords, API keys, and other credentials. Storing these secrets data directly in your code can be risky and exposing it can lead to potential security breaches.

HyperExecute provides a secure and user-friendly solution for managing your secrets during testing. This documentation will guide you through utilizing HyperExecute's **Secret Management Vault** to keep your sensitive information safe and secure.

<Info>
**These Secrets are stored as `key:value` pair where these **values** are not visible or accessible to anyone but can only be [updated](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-save-and-manage-secrets/#update-your-existing-secrets) with a new value.**

## Using Secrets in YAML

During HyperExecute test execution, you might need to access sensitive information like environment variables or access tokens. This section guides you on how to securely integrate these secrets into your YAML file.

Consider these secret key names: `secretKey1` and `secretKey2`.

```yaml
version: 0.1
env:
  MyKey1: ${{.secrets.token}}
 
runson: win
testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: dynamic
  args:
    featureFilePath: ${Path}
     
testRunnerCommand: npm run --username abc --password ${{.secrets.SecretKey2}}
```

- The `env` and `vars` sections within your YAML file are used to define variables.
- The syntax `{{.secrets.secretKey1}}` allows you to access the corresponding secret value stored securely in HyperExecute.

In the above sample YAML file:

- **MyKey1** in the env section uses `secretKey1`.
- **MyKey2** in the vars section uses `secretKey2`.
- **testRunnerCommand** utilizes `secretKey2` for the password.

{/* Since we do not have SecretKey3 saved. CLI will error out with "**SecretKey3 not found in vault.**" */}

<Info>
- By using secrets within your YAML file, you avoid embedding sensitive information directly in your code, enhancing security.**

- HyperExecute securely retrieves these secrets from its storage i.e. **HashiCorp Vault** at runtime, ensuring they are not exposed during code sharing or storage.
