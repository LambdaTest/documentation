Cypress is a modern web front-end testing tool built with JavaScript Mocha. It operates directly on the browsers without the need for Selenium. Its unique DOM manipulation technique makes it a very developer and QA-friendly tool.

Integrating <BrandName /> with Cypress allows you to perform Cypress testing across 40+ browser versions on cloud.

In this guide, learn how to get started with Cypress testing on the <BrandName /> platform. We will use Cypress’ kitchen sink sample app to execute our tests. 

## Prerequisites
---

<Tip>
**Sample repo**

Before we get started, make sure to clone the <BrandName />'s sample Cypress Cloud repo, used in this document. <GitHubButton url="https://github.com/LambdaTest/Cypress-Cloud" />

</Tip>

You can run your first Cypress test on the <BrandName /> platform in a few simple steps:

1. Clone the <BrandName />-Cypress-Cloud GitHub repo and navigate to the cloned directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/Cypress-Cloud.git
cd Cypress-Cloud
```

2. To run Cypress tests, you will need to set your <BrandName /> username and access key in the environment variables. You can get them from the <BrandName /> Automation Dashboard.

**Windows**

```js
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

**macOS/Linux**

```js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
3. Install Node.js version 12 or higher. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Running Your First Test
---

Following are the steps to run your first Cypress test on the <BrandName /> platform.

1. Install the <BrandName />-Cypress CLI using the below command.

```bash
npm install -g testmu ai-cypress-cli
```

2. Clone the Cypress kitchen sink repo using the following command.

<Tab title="Cypress v10">

```bash
# Clone the kitchen sink repo
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink.git

# Go to the cloned directory
cd cypress-example-kitchensink
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Cypress v9">

```bash
# Clone the kitchen sink repo
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink.git

# Go to the cloned directory
cd cypress-example-kitchensink

# Checkout to this commit
git checkout ab10094ef7b199ae7febafec413a0626414bcd3c  
```

</Tab>

Once you clone the kitchen sink repo, below will be the structure of your Cypress project.

```bash
...
cypress

...
```

<Tab title="Cypress v9">

```bash
...
cypress
|-- fixtures
|-- integration
|-- plugins
|-- support
cypress.json
...
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

3. Install the npm dependencies by passing the below command.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create `testmu ai-config.json` file that contains configurations like auth, capabilities, test settings, etc. which need to be successfully executed at LambaTest.

Use `init` command to generate the sample configuration files.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<Tab title="Cypress v10">

```bash
testmu ai-cypress init --cv=10
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Cypress v9">

```bash
testmu ai-cypress init 
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Once you run the above command, below is the project structure for the `testmu ai-config.json` file.

5. Pass the below command to run the test.

```bash
testmu ai-cypress run
```

6. Visit <BrandName /> Automation dashboard to view your test results. The CLI also has a link to view the Cypress test build.

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects 
---

To tests locally hosted websites on the <BrandName /> platform, you need to setup [<BrandName /> tunnel](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/), and execute commands using the CLI, or [Download UnderPass](/support/docs/underpass-tunnel-application/), our GUI based desktop app. Once you have the <BrandName /> tunnel or Underpass set up and started, you can use Cypress to test locally hosted websites.

Now you need to activate the tunnel capability in the `testmu ai-config.json` file under the section "tunnel_settings" as shown below:

```json 
  "tunnel_settings": {
		"tunnel": true,
		"tunnel_name": "LT_Tunnel"
	}
```

You can provide the name of the **<BrandName /> tunnel** as per your requirements.
