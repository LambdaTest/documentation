Integrating LambdaTest with Cypress allows you to perform Cypress testing across 40+ browser versions on cloud.

In this guide, learn how to get started with Cypress testing on the LambdaTest platform. We will use Cypress’ kitchen sink sample app to execute our tests.

## Prerequisites

<Check>
**SAMPLE REPO**

Before we get started, make sure to clone the LambdaTest's sample Cypress Cloud repo, used in this document.

<GitHubButton url="https://github.com/LambdaTest/Cypress-Cloud" />
</Check>

You can run your first Cypress test on the LambdaTest platform in a few simple steps:

<Steps>
<Step>
Clone the LambdaTest-Cypress-Cloud GitHub repo and navigate to the cloned directory.

```bash lines
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/Cypress-Cloud.gitcd Cypress-Cloud
```
</Step>
<Step>
To run Cypress tests, you will need to set your LambdaTest username and access key in the environment variables. You can get them from the LambdaTest Automation Dashboard.

<CodeGroup>
```bash lines Windows
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
```bash lines macOS/Linux
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step>
Install Node.js version 12 or higher. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
</Step>
</Steps>

## Running Your First Test

Following are the steps to run your first Cypress test on the LambdaTest platform.

<Steps>
<Step>
Install the LambdaTest-Cypress CLI using the below command.

```bash lines
npm install -g lambdatest-cypress-cli
```
</Step>
<Step>
Clone the Cypress kitchen sink repo using the following command.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Cypress v10 lines
# Clone the kitchen sink repo
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink.git

# Go to the cloned directory
cd cypress-example-kitchensink
```

```bash Cypress v9 lines
# Clone the kitchen sink repo
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink.git

# Go to the cloned directory
cd cypress-example-kitchensink

# Checkout to this commit
git checkout ab10094ef7b199ae7febafec413a0626414bcd3c
```
</CodeGroup>

Once you clone the kitchen sink repo, below will be the structure of your Cypress project.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Cypress v10 lines
...
cypress
|-- fixtures
|-- e2e
|-- support
cypress.config.js
...
```

```bash Cypress v9 lines
...
cypress
|-- fixtures
|-- integration
|-- plugins
|-- support
cypress.json
...
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step>
Install the npm dependencies by passing the below command.

```bash lines
npm install
```
</Step>
<Step>
Create `lambdatest-config.json` file that contains configurations like auth, capabilities, test settings, etc. which need to be successfully executed at LambaTest.

Use `init` command to generate the sample configuration files.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Cypress v10 lines
lambdatest-cypress init --cv=10
```

```bash Cypress v9 lines
lambdatest-cypress init
```
</CodeGroup>

Once you run the above command, below is the project structure for the `lambdatest-config.json` file.

<CodeGroup>

```json Cypress v10 
{
  "lambdatest_auth": {
     "username": "<Your LambdaTest username>",
     "access_key": "<Your LambdaTest access key>"

  }
}
```

     }
  },
  "tunnel_settings": {
     "tunnel": false,
     "tunnel_name": null
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>

<Step>
Pass the below command to run the test.

```bash lines
lambdatest-cypress run
```
</Step>
<Step>
Visit LambdaTest Automation dashboard to view your test results. The CLI also has a link to view the Cypress test build.

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

To tests locally hosted websites on the LambdaTest platform, you need to setup [LambdaTest tunnel](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/), and execute commands using the CLI, or [Download UnderPass](/support/docs/underpass-tunnel-application/), our GUI based desktop app. Once you have the LambdaTest tunnel or Underpass set up and started, you can use Cypress to test locally hosted websites.

Now you need to activate the tunnel capability in the `lambdatest-config.json` file under the section "tunnel\_settings" as shown below:

```json lines expandable
  "tunnel_settings": {
		"tunnel": true,
		"tunnel_name": "LT_Tunnel"
	}
```

You can provide the name of the **LambdaTest tunnel** as per your requirements.
