The TeamCity plugin will help you to manage your Lambdatest credentials, write and execute tests directly on the Lambdatest platform, and test your local, internal, dev, or stage environments securely with the help of Lambda Tunnel.

## Downloading The TeamCity Plugin From Marketplace

Visit the [JetBrains marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/) and enter "Lambdatest" in the search bar.

## Configuring Project To Use Lambdatest TeamCity Plugin
* * *
For demo purpose, we have used this sample Github repository. Below are the steps on how to configure the project:

1. In this sample TeamCity server project, we have used two basic steps as a part of the test, based on the Github repo.

![teamcity github](/assets/images/teamcity-plugin/teamcity-server-project.webp)

2. Now to configure your *Build Features*, visit the **Build Features** from the left bar and click on the button to **Add Build Feature**.

![build feature](/assets/images/teamcity-plugin/build-feature.webp)

3. In the drop down box that appears, choose the **Lambdatest** feature.

![lambdatest feature](/assets/images/teamcity-plugin/lambdatest-features.webp)

4. Now a window will appear where you can configure the Lambdatest feature. Insert your Lambdatest username and access key into it and save the feature. You can fetch your username and access key from your Lambdatest [profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).

![lambdatest profile](/assets/images/teamcity-plugin/configure-lambdatest-feature.webp)

5. Upon saving, you can see that the Lambdatest build feature has been added in your project.

![teamcity project](/assets/images/teamcity-plugin/lt-build-features.webp)

That’s it. Your project has been successfully configured to run tests using the Lambdatest TeamCity plugin.

## Executing The Test On Lambdatest
* * *
Upon executing the project, you can see the test status and the automation report directly on your [automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/timeline/).

## Configuring Lambda Tunnel For Local Testing
* * *
To test your locally or privately hosted website, or your dev or stage environments securely, you can make use of [Lambda Tunnel](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/). To activate the Tunnel in your project, while adding the Lambdatest build feature, make sure to tick the **Enable LAMBDATEST TUNNEL** option.

![lambda tunnel](/assets/images/teamcity-plugin/enable-lambda-tunnel.webp)

If you want to save the Tunnel binary file in a specific location, you provide its path in the **LAMBDATEST TUNNEL Path** option. If not provided, ‘checkout directory’ will be chosen to download and install the Lambda Tunnel Binary.

Also, you can also customize this tunnel based on your requirements, using the Tunnel modifiers. For example, we have used the *–tunnelName* modifier to customize the Tunnel connection name.

`--tunnelName TeamCity`

To know more about the Tunnel modifiers, please refer [here](/support/docs/lambda-tunnel-modifiers/).

## Testing Privately Hosted Site Using Lambdatest TeamCity Plugin
* * *
After the above configuration of Lambda Tunnel in your project’s Build Features, you can now execute your local projects and test your localhost, dev, or even stage environments securely with just a click.

Once you run your tests, you can see the Lambda Tunnel getting activated during your test execution, on the toolbar of your Lambdatest’s automation dashboard, as shown below.
