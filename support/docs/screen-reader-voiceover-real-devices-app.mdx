Manual accessibility testing ensures that your app or website is fully accessible and compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). With iOS VoiceOver feature on <BrandName />, you can test the accessibility of your website on supported real iOS devices. 

Ensuring accessibility with VoiceOver is essential for creating inclusive digital experiences that accommodate users with visual impairments. VoiceOver provides spoken feedback, allowing users to navigate, interact, and understand UI elements without relying on visual cues.

<Note>
This feature is currently in **Closed Beta**

## How to Navigate using Keyboard Shortcuts

The navigation behavior on iOS—such as moving to the next or previous element, auto-reading from the start of the page, and interacting with UI elements—can be performed using keyboard shortcuts when **VoiceOver** is enabled.

On a real iOS device, VoiceOver navigation can be executed via keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures as well . However, when performing  accessibility testing, using keyboard shortcuts is the most efficient way to validate VoiceOver interactions.

Ensuring that your website or application is accessible using **keyboard shortcuts** guarantees that it will also be accessible through touch gestures. If a site is fully navigable and interactable using VoiceOver keyboard commands, it will be equally accessible through swipe gestures and VoiceOver touch commands.

To navigate and interact using VoiceOver on iOS in a Manual test session, use the following keyboard shortcuts:

## VoiceOver Keyboard Shortcuts

Below is a list of VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts, using `Control+Option` on macOS and `Ctrl+Alt` on Windows. These commands allow seamless navigation and interaction with UI elements.
