<Note>
Test Distribution of the suite is recommended to be at **test level** such that each HyperExecute stage has one test.
</Note>

To execute the Test Plan with HyperExecute, you will have to follow the below mentioned steps:

**Step 1:** Download these exeutable files and place it in the root directory of your test suite.

| Binary | Download Link |
|--------|---------------|
| Testplan Discovery | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/testplan-discovery-win.exe |
| Testplan Status | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/testplan-status-update-win.exe |
| Test Link Attachment | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/test-link-attach-win.exe |

**Step 2:** Add the following command in your YAML file

```yaml
testDiscovery:
  command: testplan-discovery-win.exe <test_plan_id> <test_suite_id> <azure_org> <azure_project> <azure_access_token>
  mode: static
  type: raw
```

**Step 3:** To keep the test case distribution perfectly, make sure you pass the `dynamicAllocation` flag as `true`.

```yaml
dynamicAllocation: true
```

**Step 4:** Now, you need to pass the following command in your YAML file.

```yaml
testRunnerCommand: dotnet test path\of\dll --settings path\of\runsettings --filter '"Name=$test"' ; ./testplan-status-update-win.exe <testplan_id> <test_suite_id> <azure_org> <azure_project> <azure_access_token> <lt_username> <lt_access_key> ; ./test-link-attach-win.exe <azure_org_name> <azure_project_name> <azure_access_token>
```

**Step 5:** Trigger your test plan on HyperExecute.

- Download the Hyperexecute CLI Binary based on the OS you use.

| Platform | Download Link |
|-----------|--------------|
| Windows |	https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| macOS |	https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |
| Linux |	https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |

- Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Linux / MacOS
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

```powershell Windows
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
In case of MAC, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run `chmod u+x ./hyperexecute` to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General tab**.
</Note>

- Run the below command in your terminal at the root folder of the project

```bash
./hyperexecute --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

OR use this command if you have not exported your username and access key.

```bash
./hyperexecute --user YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME --key YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```
