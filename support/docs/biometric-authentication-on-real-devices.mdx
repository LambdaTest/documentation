Biometric Authentication is a security mechanism that utilizes unique biological traits to verify user identities. This feature is commonly implemented in native applications to enhance security while providing a frictionless user experience.

<BrandName /> has extended its testing capabilities to include Biometric Authentication support for both iOS and Android real devices. This enhancement enables developers and QA teams to thoroughly evaluate their application's biometric authentication functionality across diverse device ecosystems.

<Tab value="bash" title="iOS" default>

  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    | Supported APIs |
    |----------------|
    | `LAContext`: The LAContext class is used to interact with the local authentication framework.|
    | `evaluatePolicy`: The evaluatePolicy(_:localizedReason:reply:) method of LAContext used to actually perform the biometric authentication, such as verifying a user's face or fingerprint. |
    |`canEvaluatePolicy`: The canEvaluatePolicy(_:error:) method of LAContext that checks whether a specific biometric authentication policy can be evaluated on the device.|

## Biometric Authentication in Real Device App Testing

This feature allows you to simulate successful or failed biometric authentication during real-time app testing. Follow the steps below to enable biometric authentication in your testing session:

**Step 1:** Click on the **Real Devices** > **App Testing**

**Step 2:** Select your required device and upload your application which supports the camera APIs listed above.

**Step 3:** Now, hover over your app and click on the **Settings** icon. Toggle the **Biometric Authentication** option and click on **Save Changes** button. Click on **Start** to run your app on the selected device.

<Note>
**INFO**

After uploading your application, please wait atleast for 1-2 minutes for the application file patching process to complete.
