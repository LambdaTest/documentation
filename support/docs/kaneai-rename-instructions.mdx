## Overview

The **Rename Test Steps** feature allows users to change a test step’s name without changing how it works.  

**Benefits:**  
- Improves readability of test steps  
- No impact on execution or instruction logic  
- Renamed step name stays even if instruction changes later
- Works for Web and Mobile slash command instructions
- The step names are updated even in the execution command logs.

## How to Use

1. Ensure the authoring session is running and the relevant step is visible.
2. Pause the session. Renaming only works in "DRAFT" session state after session is Paused. 
3. Click on the step name to make it editable.  
4. Enter the new name and press **Enter** or click outside to save.
5. Resume the session.  

<Note>
**Note:** Only the step name changes; the instruction logic and behavior remain the same.
