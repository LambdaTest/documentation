This article will guide you on how to integrate the **<BrandName />** platform with **ReportPortal.io** platform for running your **Cypress** automation tests. Before you can get started, make sure you have an account on [ReportPortal.io](http://reportportal.io/).

<Note>
By default, the <BrandName /> **Cypress-Multi-Reporter** mechanism generates **mochaawesome**. To override it with some other reporting options (report portal in this case), you have to create a different file to define the reporting configuration.

## Steps To Integrate

- Navigate to [ReportPortal.io](http://reportportal.io/) and login into your account. Then open your **Report Portal IO Profile**.
