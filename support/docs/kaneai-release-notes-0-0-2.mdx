## 1\. Iframe, Shadow DOM, and Canvas Support <span className="bg-purple-600 text-white px-4 py-1 text-xs rounded-full text-nowrap">Web Agent</span>

KaneAI now fully supports testing for:

- Iframe elements 🖼️
- Shadow DOM elements 🕶️

We've gone the extra mile to bring full iframe, Shadow DOM, and Canvas support in code exports 🖥️. Now, KaneAI handles these intricate UI elements with precision during script generation, making your automation journey even smoother. Whether dealing with complex nested iframes or shadow-rooted elements, KaneAI has you covered!

## 2. Auto-Scroll for Manual Interaction  🎯  <span className="bg-purple-600 text-white px-4 py-1 text-xs rounded-full text-nowrap">Web Agent</span>

No more searching for the latest entries after clicking! KaneAI now automatically scrolls to the latest interaction in manual testing sessions, saving time and making testing more efficient.
