## What is Live Interaction?

**Live Interaction** is a feature introduced within automation testing that allows the user to take control of the session **manually**. This helps abort the automated test session, **debug** any exception in **real-time**, and effectively report a test session.

## Why Live Interaction?

- It allows the user to partially interact by clicking a button or filling OS-specific credentials without breaking the currently running automated tests.
- It is a powerful tool to find the root cause of the exception raised during the automated tests and even allow them to debug the exception during the session.
- It works smartly by letting the stakeholders know who has stopped/paused the test, which helps effectively report the issue.

## Prerequisites and Limitations

- Live interaction is available on: 
   - **Windows**: 11, 10, 8, and 8.1
   - **macOS**: Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura
   - All browsers except **Safari**.
- The user can only interact with the browser for **15 minutes**.
