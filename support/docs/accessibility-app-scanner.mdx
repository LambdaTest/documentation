### Step 5: Review Accessibility Issues
After scanning, you’ll see a categorized list of issues based on severity (Critical, Serious, Moderate, Minor). Each issue includes:
- Description of the accessibility problem.

- Suggested fix or recommendation.

Continue testing by navigating to additional screens in the app and scanning them one-by-one. This helps ensure that your entire app meets accessibility standards across all flows and use cases.
