The KaneAI Modules feature is a powerful tool for optimizing your testing processes. By converting test steps into reusable modules, you can enhance productivity and maintain accuracy in your test executions. Follow this guide to fully utilize this feature and maximize the potential of your testing workflows.

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Author Your test using KaneAI
