<RealDeviceTag value="Real Device" /> <VirtualDeviceTag value="Virtual Device" />

In this documentation, you will learn how to trigger a automation script of **Rspec** for application testing with **Appium** on <BrandName />, set the [**desired capabilities**](/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/) for appium testing, and other advanced features of <BrandName />.

## Prerequisites

- Your <BrandName /> [Username and Access key](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security).
- Install **Ruby** on your local system.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<Tab title="macOS">

For **macOS**, you can run a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) command like this:

```bash
brew install ruby
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Linux">

For **Linux** or **Ubuntu**, you can run a simple apt command like below:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">

For **Windows**, you can download from the [official website](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
</Tab>
</Tabs>

- Ensure you have Dependency manager bundler installed. If not installed, you can install with the following command:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

## Try our Sample Repository

### Step 1: Get a Sample Project
You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Tip>
**Sample repo**

All the code samples in this documentation can be found on **<BrandName />'s Github Repository**. You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests. <a href="https://github.com/<BrandName />/LT-appium-ruby-rspec" className="github__anchor"><img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/icons/github.png' alt="Image" /> View on GitHub</a>
</Tip>

### Step 2: Setup the Environment Variables

You need to export your environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in your [<BrandName /> Profile page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security). Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the environment variables.

<Tabs className="docs__val">
<Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
  ```bash

  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Windows">
  ```powershell

  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Upload your Application
Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk or .aab file) to the <BrandName /> servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication.

Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Below is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<Tab title="App File">
  ```bash

      {`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"" -F "name="proverbial_app""`}
    
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="App URL">
  ```bash

      {`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "url=:https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk" -F "name=Proverbial_App"`}
    
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Tip>
**- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on <BrandName /> by using our sample apps, :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).**

- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `APP_URL` of the format - `lt://APP123456789123456789` and will be used in the next step

</Tip>

### Step 4: Update your Automation Script

An automation script for the sample application given above has been provided here. Ensure to update the `APP_URL`, `username` and `accessKey` in the code scripts before running the tests.

<Tabs className="docs__val">
<Tab title="Single Test">

```ruby title="single.config.yml"
server: "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com"
user: "LT_USERNAME"         #Add your TestMu AI username here
key: "LT_ACCESS_KEY"  #Add your TestMu AI accessKey here

common_caps:
  "build": "RSpec Selenium Demo"

browser_caps:
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "Android"
    "deviceName": "Galaxy A31"
    "platformVersion": "10"
    "app": "APP_URL"        #Add the app url here
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Parallel test">

```ruby title="parallel.config.yml"
server: "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com"
user: "LT_USERNAME"  #Add your TestMu AI username here
key: "LT_ACCESS_KEY"  #Add your TestMu AI accessKey here

common_caps:
  "build": "RSpec Parallel"
  "visual": false
  "network": false
  "console": false

app_caps:
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "Android"
    "deviceName": "Galaxy A31"
    "platformVersion": "10"
    "app": "APP_URL"   #Add the app url here
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "Android"
    "deviceName": "Galaxy A32"
    "platformVersion": "11"
    "app": "APP_URL"   #Add the app url here
  -
    "isRealMobile": "true"
    "platform": "iOS"
    "deviceName": "iPhone 13 Pro"
    "platformVersion": "15.0"
    "app": "APP_URL"   #Add the app url here
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>
<Tip>
**- You must set **isRealMobile** capability to `False` in the config file to run on **Virtual Devices****

- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt [**Capabilities Generator tool**](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/).For more details, please refer to our guide on [**Desired Capabilities in Appium**](/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/).
</Tip>

### Step 5: Configure the Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts `testmu ai.rb`. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url _(generated earlier)_ along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object.

The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

```ruby
    caps={
      "LT:Options" => {
        "build" => "Ruby RSpec",
        "name" => "Sample Test",
        "platformName" => platform,
        "isRealMobile" => isRealMobile,
        "deviceName" => deviceName,
        "platformVersion" => platformVersion,
        "app" => app,
        "w3c" => true
      }},
```

<Info>
**- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `app` capability in the config file.**

- You must set **isRealMobile** capability to `False` in the config file to run on **Virtual Devices**
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt [**Capabilities Generator tool**](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/).For more details, please refer to our guide on [**Desired Capabilities in Appium**](/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/).

</Info>

### Step 6: Execute and Monitor your Tests

- Run the following command to make sure that all the dependencies required for the test are installed.
```bash
bundle install
```

2. Execute the following command to run single test on <BrandName /> platform:
```bash
bundle exec rake single
```

> In order to run parallel tests, run `bundle exec rake parallel`. Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or CLI if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [<BrandName /> App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
