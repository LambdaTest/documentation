<Tab title='Project Token'>

**Project Token**

The Project Token is a unique identifier that authenticates your SmartUI project for executing tests locally with CLI and APIs. You'll find your Project Token in the Project Settings after creating a project.

**Setting Up Project Token**

Use this key to authenticate your SmartUI project for executing locally with CLI and APIs.

<Tabs>
<Tab title='MacOS/Linux'>

```bash
export PROJECT_TOKEN='project#token'
```

</Tabs>

### Using Project Token

The Project Token is required for:
- CLI executions (`npx smartui exec`, `npx smartui capture`)
- API uploads
- Local test execution
- CI/CD pipeline integrations

<Info>
INFO

Keep your Project Token secure and never commit it to version control. Use environment variables or secret management tools in CI/CD pipelines.

- **Project Name:** Customize the name of your project to enhance its identification.

<Info>
INFO

Changing the Project Name will automatically update the `smartUI.project` capability's options for Web/App projects.
</Info>

- **Approvers:** Manage the list of authorized individuals responsible for approving changes within the project.

<Info>
INFO

Altering Approvers will impact email notifications, which will be sent to the latest approver list for recent builds.
</Info>

- **Tags:** Add tags to your project for better organization and categorization.

</Tab>

<Tab title='Comparison Settings'>

**Comparison Settings**

![Comparison Settings](/assets/images/smart-visual-testing/comparison.png)

Comparison settings allow you to fine-tune how SmartUI compares screenshots, balancing between highlighting important changes and ignoring noise.

**Pixel Threshold**

Strike a balance between highlighting important changes and ignoring noise. The pixel threshold determines the sensitivity of the comparison algorithm.

**Options:**
- **Relaxed**: Higher threshold, fewer differences detected (good for pages with minor rendering variations)
- **Recommended**: Balanced threshold (default, suitable for most use cases)
- **Strict**: Lower threshold, more differences detected (good for precise comparisons)
- **Custom**: Set a custom threshold value (0-10000)

**Example:**
- Custom value: `5000` - Higher value means more tolerance for pixel differences

<Info>
INFO

Adjusting the Pixel Threshold in Comparison Settings will only affect new builds/screenshots captured after the update.
</Info>

**Error Highlight Color**

Set the color to show/highlight the changes in the pixel differences on your test output.

**Available Colors:**
- Red (default)
- Blue
- Orange
- Green
- Pink
- Gray
- Custom: Enter a hex color code (e.g., `#f687b3`)

**Use Case**: Choose a color that provides good contrast against your page background for easier visual identification of differences.

**Custom Mismatch Acceptance**

Configure pixel-to-pixel acceptance percentage for auto-approval.

**Settings:**
- **Accept**: Percentage threshold for auto-approval (0-100)
- **Reject**: Percentage threshold for auto-rejection (0-100)

**Example:**
- Accept: `0%` - No auto-approval
- Reject: `100%` - Auto-reject all differences

**Use Case**: Automatically approve screenshots with differences below the acceptance threshold, reducing manual review time.

**Smart Ignore**

Highlight content changes while smartly ignoring layout shifts and displacement differences.

**Toggle**: Enable/disable Smart Ignore for the project

**Benefits:**
- Reduces false positives from layout shifts
- Focuses on actual content changes
- Improves test reliability

For detailed information, refer to [Smart Ignore Documentation](/support/docs/smartui-smartignore).

**Bounding Boxes**

Configure your areas to which needs to be ignored or select a specific area for comparison.

**Use Cases:**
- Ignore specific regions (ads, dynamic content)
- Focus comparison on specific areas (main content, critical UI)
- Define regions of interest for comparison

**Advanced Comparison Settings**

Manage your Pixel to Pixel false positives and comparison view types.

**Ignore Pixel Scaling Options**

Choose options to remove the Pixel to Pixel false-positive rate in identifying the screenshot.

**Options:**
- **Ignore Antialiasing**: Ignore differences caused by antialiasing rendering
- **Ignore Less**: Minimal pixel difference tolerance
- **Ignore Nothing**: No pixel difference tolerance (strictest)
- **Ignore Alpha**: Ignore alpha channel differences
- **Ignore Colors**: Ignore color differences, focus on structure

**Use Case**: Reduce false positives from rendering differences, browser-specific rendering, or minor pixel variations.

**Error Type Identifier**

Show the differences in the output screen by identifying the pixel changes type and capture the intended view.

**Options:**
- **Flat**: Simple difference highlighting
- **Movement**: Highlight elements that moved
- **Movement with Diff Intensity**: Show movement with intensity levels
- **Diff portion from the Input**: Show only the different portions
- **Flat with Diff Intensity**: Flat view with intensity levels

**Use Case**: Choose the view that best helps you identify and understand the differences in your screenshots.

**Transparency**

Strike a balance between highlighting differences and maintaining visibility of the underlying content.

**Options:**
- **Opaque**: Full opacity, clear difference highlighting
- **Transparent**: Lower opacity, see underlying content

**Use Case**: Adjust transparency to see both the differences and the original content for better context.

**Resize Image**

Ability to scale the test screenshot according to baseline.

**Options:**
- **Use Original Image**: Compare at original size
- **Scale to same size**: Scale screenshots to match baseline size

**Use Case**: Handle cases where screenshots are captured at different resolutions or viewport sizes.

<Info>
INFO

Changes to Project Settings will impact builds/comparisons executed after the changes and the previous builds/comparisons remain unaffected.
</Info>

**Additional Information:**
For detailed information on these options, refer to our [Comparison Settings Documentation](/support/docs/test-settings-options/).

**Smart Baseline**

![cmd](/assets/images/smart-visual-testing/smart_baseline_ss.png)

Smart Baseline is a feature that simplifies and automates the process of updating the baseline for approved screenshots in your baseline build. This feature provides convenience and efficiency by ensuring your baseline remains in sync with approved changes without manual intervention.

![cmd](/assets/images/smart-visual-testing/smart_baseline.png)

- **Baseline Branch:** A baseline branch build consists of screenshots captured using SmartUI. All screenshots in this build are compared against non-baseline branch builds.

- **Non-Baseline Branches:** Non-baseline branch(s) builds are sets of screenshots captured using SmartUI. All screenshots in these builds are compared against the baseline build, matching them by screenshot names.

<Info>
INFO

When **`Smart Baseline`** is turned on, the system automatically updates the baseline for approved screenshots in the baseline build, streamlining the testing process and saving time.
</Info>

<Warning>

Warning
Please note that this feature is not supported for projects integrated with `Git` as `Git`-based projects follow a [Git branching strategy](/support/docs/smartui-github-app-integration/).
</Warning>

**Git Settings**

Configure Git-related settings for your project, including the baseline branch name, auto-approval branches, GitHub repository linkage, and run status checks.

**Additional Information:**
For detailed information on these options, refer to our [Git Baseline Branching Documentation](/support/docs/smartui-github-app-integration/).

**Overwrite Screenshot**

![cmd](/assets/images/smart-visual-testing/overwrite_ss.png)

- This feature allows to update and overwrite screenshots with the same name, ensuring that the latest version is updated for that screenshot.

- This capability provides users with more control over the management of screenshots with identical names, enabling them to maintain accurate visual records and efficiently track changes in their application's user interface over time.
