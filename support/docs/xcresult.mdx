# XCResult on <BrandName />
<RealDeviceTag value="Real Device" />
Apple’s **Native XCResult Bundles (`.xcresult`)** are comprehensive test reports generated when you run XCUITest cases. These bundles include **test hierarchy, logs, stack traces, screenshots, and performance data**, which can be directly viewed in Xcode. They provide developers with rich debugging information, making it easier to analyze why a test passed or failed.  

On <BrandName />, you can now **generate and download `.xcresult` bundles** for your XCUI test sessions. You can access them via the **REST API**.

---
## Prerequisites

- Your <BrandName /> [Username and Access Key](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security).  
- Access to an **iOS app (.ipa)** and an **XCUI Test app (.ipa)**.  
- Xcode installed locally to view `.xcresult` bundles.  

---

## Flow for Adding XCUI Result Bundles

### Step 1: Upload Your Application and Test Suite

To begin testing, you need to upload both your iOS application (.ipa) file and your XCUI test suite (.ipa) file to <BrandName />. These files are required before executing tests.

Detailed upload steps are available here: [Getting Started with XCUI Testing – Running Your First Test](/support/docs/getting-started-with-xcuitest/#running-your-first-test-a-step-by-step-guide)

### Step 2: Execute Your Tests with Result Bundles

To generate `.xcresult` bundles for your XCUI test executions, you must pass `"enableResultBundle": true` in your build request and use the new build endpoint:

```
POST https://mobile-api.lambdatest.com/mobile-automation/api/v1/xcuitest/builds
```

This endpoint initiates your test run and enables generation of the result bundle.

| Parameter          | Description                                           | Values                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| enableResultBundle  | Enable generating result bundles for your XCUI build. | true/false (default: false)    |

Below is an example cURL command to execute your test with result bundles enabled:

--data-raw "{
  \"app\" : \"APP_ID\",
  \"testSuite\": \"TEST_SUITE_ID\",
  \"device\" :  [\"iPhone 11-14\"],
  \"video\" : true,
  \"queueTimeout\": 10800,
  \"idleTimeout\": 150,
  \"devicelog\": true,
  \"network\": false,
  \"build\" : \"Proverbial-XCUITest\",
  \"enableResultBundle\": true
}"
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Retrieve the Result Bundle

Result bundles are generated at the Build level. To download the `.xcresult` bundle for a specific session, use the following GET endpoint:

<Note>
**- In case of sharding, each shard execution is treated as a separate shards and generates its own `.xcresult` bundle. You will need to retrieve each shard's bundle individually. For more information, see [Sharding in HyperExecute](/support/docs/sharding-rd-hyperexec/).**

- To view the `.xcresult` for a specific shard, you must pass the `shard:shardId` as a query parameter in your request.
</Note>

```
GET https://mobile-api.lambdatest.com/mobile-automation/api/v1/framework/builds/{build-id}/xcresult
```

Replace `{build-id}` with the actual build ID.

Example cURL command to download the result bundle:

```bash

curl --location --request GET \\
'https://mobile-api.lambdatest.com/mobile-automation/api/v1/framework/builds/{build-id}/xcresult' \\
--header 'Authorization: Basic BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN' \\
--output xcui-result-bundle.zip
  
```

<Tip>
**You will need your **BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN** (Base64 encoded `username:accesskey`) in the request header.  **

If you’re unsure how to generate it, follow the instructions here: [Executing the Test](/support/docs/getting-started-with-xcuitest/#step-3-executing-the-test).
</Tip>

The response is a binary ZIP file containing the `.xcresult` bundle, which you can unzip and open directly in Xcode for detailed analysis.

### Step 4: Report Structure

The `.xcresult` bundle contains a comprehensive report of your XCUI test execution, including:

- **Summary View**: Shows total tests executed, number passed, and number failed with a visual chart.
- **Errors Section**: Lists any critical errors or crashes encountered (e.g., test runner crashes with signal codes).
- **Tests Section**: Provides execution duration, device and OS version details, and per-device results.
- **Device & Configuration Matrix**: Displays which tests passed/failed on specific device configurations.
- **Individual Test Details**: Each test case shows its status (pass/fail), failure reason, logs, and any assertion errors.

You can open the `.xcresult` bundle directly in Xcode to explore these details visually, enabling efficient debugging and analysis of your test runs.
