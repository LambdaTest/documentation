## Enhanced `failFast` at the Scenario Level
We have made am enhancement to our test configuration: the ability to use [`failFast`](http://lambdatest.com/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#failfast) at the scenario level!

Previously, `failFast` could only be applied at the test level. Now, with this update, you can configure `failFast` to stop further scenario execution after a specified number of failed scenarios, providing more granular control over your testing process.

### Key Features:
- **Granular Control:** Apply failFast to individual scenarios instead of the entire test suite.
- **Easy Configuration:** Simply set the level to scenario in the YAML configuration.
- **Max Test Failures:** Control the maximum number of allowed test failures at the scenario level.

Example YAML Configuration:

```yaml
failFast:
  maxNumberOfTests: 2
  level: scenario
```

<Note>
**Note:** You can use `failFast` either at the test level or scenario level, but not both simultaneously.
</Note>

This enhancement brings more flexibility to your testing setup, helping you better manage the execution flow and quickly pinpoint issues.
