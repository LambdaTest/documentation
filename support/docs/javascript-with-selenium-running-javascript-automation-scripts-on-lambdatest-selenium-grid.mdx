In this topic, you will learn how to automate your website testing using Selenium with **Javascript** Web Automation on [LambdaTest Selenium cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation).

## Objective
---
By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **Javascript** automated testing.
2. Understand & configure **Javascript** desired capabilities for executing a test on a selenium grid.
3. Test your locally hosted pages on LambdaTest platform.
4. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

<Warning>
**NOTE**

All the code samples in this documentation can be found in the [LambdaTest's Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LambdaTest/nodejs-selenium-sample). You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites For Running JavaScript With Selenium
---
Before getting started with Selenium automation testing on LambdaTest, you need to:
* Download and install **NodeJS** from official [NodeJS documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/). You should be having **NodeJS v6** or newer.
* Make sure you are using the latest version of **JavaScript**.
* Install **npm** from the official [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* Download [Selenium JavaScript bindings](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) from the official website. Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your JavaScript automation testing script on LambdaTest’s Selenium Grid.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and tutorial repo

**Step 1:** Clone the LambdaTest’s [nodejs-selenium-sample](https://github.com/LambdaTest/nodejs-selenium-sample) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/nodejs-selenium-sample
cd nodejs-selenium-sample
```
You need to install the following dependencies to your `package.json` file: 

**Step 2:** You will need to install the `selenium webdriver` to make the connection to the `GRID`: 
```bash
npm install selenium-webdriver
```
**Step 3:** Create a new file as `index.js` in your current project or the sample folder and add the below code snippet which will call the installed driver. 
```js
// index.js
const webdriver = require('selenium-webdriver');
```

### Setting up Your Authentication
Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 4:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.
  * For **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
  * For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```

### Connecting to The Cloud Grid

**Step 5:** Now you can add the `GRID HOST` which is used to connect your current test suites to be executed on the cloud grid. 
```js
// index.js
const GRID_HOST = 'hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub';
const gridUrl = 'https://' + USERNAME + ':' + KEY + '@' + GRID_HOST;
const driver = new webdriver.Builder().usingServer(gridUrl).withCapabilities(capabilities).build();
```
The above grid connect will create the `Webdriver` for the test suite to execute the `Selenium` commands for your test. 

## Run Your First Test
---
### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities
**Step 6:** In the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:
```js
// index.js
const capabilities = {
        build: 'NodeJS build',  // Name of the build
        name: 'Test 1',         // Name of the test
        platform: 'windows 10', // Name of Operating System
        browserName: 'chrome',  // Name of the browser
        version: '67.0',        // Version of the browser
        resolution: '1280x800', // Resolution of the screen 
        network: true,          // Enable to capture browser network logs
        visual: true,           // Enable to capture screenshot on every command
        console: true,          // Enable to capture the console log
        video: true             // Enable to capture the video recording of the test
}
```
<Warning>
**NOTE**

You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.
</Warning>

### Writing your Test Cases

**Step 7:** Now you write your selenium test cases in your `index.js` file:
```js
function searchTextOnGoogle() {
    // navigate to a url, search for a text and get title of page
    driver.get('https://www.google.com/ncr').then(function () {
        driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('q')).sendKeys('LambdaTest\n').then(function () {
            driver.getTitle().then(function (title) {
                setTimeout(function () {
                    console.log(title);
                    driver.executeScript('lambda-status=passed');
                    driver.quit();
                }, 5000);
            });
        });
    }).catch(function (err) {
        console.log("test failed with reason " + err)
        driver.executeScript('lambda-status=failed');
        driver.quit();
    });
}
searchTextOnGoogle();
```

### Executing the Test
**Step 8:** Please execute the following command below to run your tests: 
```bash
npm test OR node index.js
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build). LambdaTest Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects
---
You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

<Warning>

Refer our  [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.
</Warning>

Here’s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

<Warning>
**DOWNLOAD THE BINARY FILE**

- [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
- [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
- [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)
</Warning>

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```js
const capabilities = {
        tunnel: true,
}
```
