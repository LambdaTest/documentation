# Mocha with Selenium: Tutorial to Run Your First Test on <BrandName />
* * *
In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your JavaScript automation testing scripts on [<BrandName /> Selenium cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using **JavaScript** framework **Mocha**.

## Objective
***
By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **Mocha** framework with **Selenium**.
2. Understand and configure the core capabilities required for your Selenium test suite.
3. Run test cases in parallel using **Mocha** with Selenium to reduce build times.
4. Test your locally hosted pages on <BrandName /> platform.
5. Explore advanced features of <BrandName />. 

>**Note:** All the code samples in this documentation can be found in the [<BrandName />'s Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/<BrandName />/mocha-selenium-sample). You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests.

## Prerequisites For Running Mocha Test Automation Scripts Using Selenium
* * *
Before getting started with Selenium automation testing on <BrandName />, you need to:
* Download and install **NodeJS** from [official NodeJS documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/). You should be having **NodeJS v6** or newer.
* Make sure you are using the latest version of **JavaScript**.
* Install **npm** from the [official npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* Download [Selenium JavaScript bindings](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) from the official website. Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your JavaScript automation testing script on <BrandName />’s Selenium Grid.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and tutorial repo

**Step 1:** Clone the <BrandName />’s [mocha-selenium-sample repository](https://github.com/<BrandName />/mocha-selenium-sample) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TestMu AI/mocha-selenium-sample
cd mocha-selenium-sample
```
**Step 2:** Install the required project dependencies using the command below:
```bash
npm i
npm install selenium-webdriver
```

### Setting up Your Authentication
Make sure you have your <BrandName /> credentials with you to run test automation scripts on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [<BrandName /> Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [<BrandName /> Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 3:** Set <BrandName /> `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.
  * For **Linux/macOS**:

```bash

{`export LT_USERNAME= "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" 
export LT_ACCESS_KEY= "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}

```

  * For **Windows**:

```bash

{`set LT_USERNAME= "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" 
set LT_ACCESS_KEY= "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}

```

## Run Your First Test
***
### Sample Test with MochaJS
```js
//single_test.js

var assert = require("assert"),
  webdriver = require("selenium-webdriver"),
  conf_file = process.argv[3] || "conf/single.conf.js";

var caps = require("../" + conf_file).capabilities;

var buildDriver = function(caps) {
  return new webdriver.Builder()
    .usingServer(
      "http://" +
      LT_USERNAME +
      ":" +
      LT_ACCESS_KEY +
      "@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"
    )
    .withCapabilities(caps)
    .build();
};

describe("Google's Search Functionality for " + caps.browserName, function() {
  var driver;
  this.timeout(0);

  beforeEach(function(done) {
    caps.name = this.currentTest.title;
    driver = buildDriver(caps);
    done();
  });

  it("can find search results", function(done) {
    driver.get("https://www.lambdatest.com").then(function() {
      driver.getTitle().then(function(title) {
        setTimeout(function() {
          console.log(title);
          assert(
            title.match(
              "Cross Browser Testing Tools | Test Your Website on Different Browsers | TestMu AI"
            ) != null
          );
          done();
        }, 10000);
      });
    });
  });

  afterEach(function(done) {
    if (this.currentTest.isPassed()) {
      driver.executeScript("lambda-status=passed");
    } else {
      driver.executeScript("lambda-status=failed");
    }
    driver.quit().then(function() {
      done();
    });
  });
});
```
### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities
**Step 4:** In `conf/single.conf.js` file, you need to update your capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with <BrandName /> Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:
```js
exports.capabilities = {
        'build': 'Mocha-Selenium-Sample', //Build name
        'name': 'Your Test Name', // Test name
        'platform':'Windows 10', // OS name
        'browserName': 'chrome', // Browser name
        'version': 'latest', // Browser version
        'visual': false,  // To take step by step screenshot
        'network':false,  // To capture network Logs
        'console':false, // To capture console logs.
        'tunnel': false // If you want to run the localhost than change it to true
};
```
<Warning>
You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **<a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/">Capabilities Generator Tool</a>**.
</Warning>


### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command.
```bash
npm run single
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [<BrandName /> automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build). <BrandName /> Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Running Your Parallel Tests Using Mocha Framework
***
### Setting up the Parallel Environment
Here is the `parallel_test.js` file which would help you to run a single test on various browsers at the same time.
```js
//parallel_test.js

var assert = require("assert"),
  webdriver = require("selenium-webdriver"),
  conf_file = process.argv[3] || "conf/single.conf.js";

var capabilities = require("../" + conf_file).capabilities;

var buildDriver = function(caps) {
  return new webdriver.Builder()
    .usingServer(
      "http://" +
        LT_USERNAME +
        ":" +
        LT_ACCESS_KEY +
        "@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"
    )
    .withCapabilities(caps)
    .build();
};

capabilities.forEach(function(caps) {
 
  describe("Google's Search Functionality for " + caps.browserName, function() {
    var driver;
    this.timeout(0);

    beforeEach(function(done) {
      caps.name = this.currentTest.title;
      driver = buildDriver(caps);
      done();
    });

    it("can find search results" + caps.browserName, function(done) {
      driver.get("https://www.lambdatest.com").then(function() {
        driver.getTitle().then(function(title) {
          setTimeout(function() {
            console.log(title);
            assert(
              title.match(
                "Cross Browser Testing Tools | Test Your Website on Different Browsers | TestMu AI"
              ) != null
            );
            done();
          }, 10000);
        });
      });
    });

    afterEach(function(done) {
      if (this.currentTest.isPassed()) {
        driver.executeScript("lambda-status=passed");
      } else {
        driver.executeScript("lambda-status=failed");
      }
      driver.quit().then(function() {
        done();
      });
    });
  });
});
```
### Executing Parallel Tests using Mocha

To run parallel tests using **Mocha**, we would have to execute the below command in the terminal:
```bash
npm run parallel
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [<BrandName /> automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build).

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects
***
You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [<BrandName /> Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using <BrandName /> Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using <BrandName /> Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. <BrandName /> Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [<BrandName /> Tunnel documentation](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Here’s how you can establish <BrandName /> Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
>* [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is testmu ai@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user testmu ai@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **<BrandName /> Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```js
const capabilities = {
        tunnel: true,
}
```
