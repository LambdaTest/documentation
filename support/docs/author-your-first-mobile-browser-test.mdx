**Step 6:** Now tell KaneAI what you want to author using natural language without the need for coding or scripting knowledge required. KaneAI translates your instructions into executable test steps automatically.

As you add each instruction, KaneAI queues them in real-time without waiting for completion. This allows you to build comprehensive test flows quickly and efficiently. Once you've outlined all your test steps, click Finish Test to finalize your automated test case.

**Step 7:** Now, select your **Project** and the folder where you want to save your test cases. The **Test Name** and **Description** will be generated automatically, but you can also edit them. Select your test's **Type** and **Status**, as well as the necessary tags that will allow you to search for it later.
