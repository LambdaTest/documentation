> Katalon Studio Integration with HyperExecute enables cross-platform testing, from web automation on Windows, macOS, and Linux to mobile automation on Android and iOS.

It also comes with a built-in interface for codeless automation testing and validating the UI elements of your web application.

## Prerequisites

## Integrating Katalon Studio with HyperExecute

1. You must generate a command from Katalon to run it through the command line. To do so:

   a. Generate a command for Console mode through the Katalon UI. Click on the **Command Builder** button on the top of the screen.

2. Clear the contents of the .gitignore file in the root directory of your Katalon project. 

3. Download the HyperExecute CLI binary in the root directory of your Katalon project. 

4. Create the hyperexecute.yaml file in the root directory of your Katalon project with the given parameters:

  ```yaml
  version: 0.1
  globalTimeout: 90
  testSuiteTimeout: 90
  testSuiteStep: 90
  
  autosplit: true
  
  runson: win
  
  tunnel: true
  tunnelOpts:
    global: true

  concurrency: 2
  
  pre: 
    - pip install requests # To install pip request
    - python installer.py # To install the certs in the Machine 

  runtime: katalon
  
  testDiscovery:
    type: raw
    mode: dynamic
    command: grep -lr 'testSuiteGuid' */*.ts | sed 's/:.*//' | sed 's/.ts//g'
  
  testRunnerCommand:  katalonc `-noSplash `-runMode=console `-projectPath="G:\foreman\Hyperexecute_Sample\Hyperexecute_Sample.prj" `-retry=0 `-testSuitePath="$test" `-browserType="firefox" `-executionProfile="default" `-apiKey="aaa9402b-6a2e-4621-a4c3-05fe356f5aad" `-`-config `-webui.autoUpdateDrivers=true
  
  retryOnFailure: false
  maxRetries: 1
  ```
  
Paste the command that you generated from the Katalon UI to fill the **testRunnerCommand** field in the _hyperexecute.yaml_ file.

5. Run the Hyperexecute CLI commands from the same path as your Katalon project. 

You have successfully integrated your Katalon Studio project with HyperExecute.
