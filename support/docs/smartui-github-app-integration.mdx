This is the guide to setup your GitHub Repos with SmartUI projects and run your CI along with visual regression testing.

## Prerequisites

- An account with GitHub with valid permission to install new applications to your repositories.
- Basic understanding of Continuous Integration tools (CI) is required.
- Should have setup the SmartUI suite, else please read [this](/support/docs/selenium-visual-regression/)

The following steps will guide you in running your first Visual Regression test on <BrandName /> SmartUI platform using GitHub App-

## Step 1: Integrate the your <BrandName /> Account with GitHub App

The following are the steps to integrate your account with GitHub App:

1. Go to [Integrations page](https://integrations.lambdatest.com/)
2. Search for GitHub App and select the integration.

3. Click on the `OAuth` as your preferred authentication.
4. Click on **Install**.

5. You will be redirected to the GitHub Authentication page to confirm the permissions required for the application to be installed.
6. Click on **Confirm** button to all the authentication requirements from your GitHub Account.
7. After successful authentication, you can refresh the [Integrations page](https://integrations.lambdatest.com/) to view the GitHub App installed.

Now, after the successful installation of the GitHub Integration, please follow the below steps to configure to your project repo:

## Step 2: Select your GitHub repository

Go to your GitHub repository where you want to configure your SmartUI project.

<Info>
**GitHub Sample**

Please check out GitHub sample here: https://github.com/<BrandName />/smartui-node-sample

</Info>

## Step 3: Configure your test suite

 Add the `GitHub` capability to your current test configuration:

```js
const capabilities: {
  platform: "Windows 10",
  browserName: "chrome",
  version: "latest",
  "smartUI.project": "SmartUI sample test",
  // highlight-start
   github: {

    "url": process.env.GITHUB_URL  // Mandatory
    //GitHub URL format-https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/statuses/commitId

   }
   // highlight-end
}
```

## Step 4: Setting up your CI configuration

Setting up your **CI** workflow to execute on **GitHub**. Here is an example setup with `GitHub Actions`:

Go to `.github/workflows/<your_ci_file>.yml`

```yaml
    name: Execute SmartUI Test with GitHub App Integration
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      with:
        fetch-depth: 10

    - name: Step for push event
      run: |
        echo "This is a push event!"
        echo "The latest commitId $(git log -1 --format='%H')"
        echo "COMMIT_ID=$(git log -1 --format='%H')" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      if: github.event_name == 'push'

    - name: Step for pull_request event
      run: |
        echo "This is a pull_request event!"
        git log -n 5 --format="%H %an %s" | while read line; do echo "$line"; done
        echo "The latest commitId $(git log -n 2 --format='%H' | tail -n 1)"
        echo "COMMIT_ID=$(git log -n 2 --format='%H' | tail -n 1)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'

    - name: Create GitHub URL
      run: |
        API_HOST=https://api.github.com
        echo "The latest commitId is $COMMIT_ID"
        GITHUB_URL=$API_HOST/repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/statuses/$COMMIT_ID
        echo "GITHUB_URL: $GITHUB_URL"
        echo "GITHUB_URL=$GITHUB_URL" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

<Info>
**Note**

We also support other Continuous Integrations (CI) tools to execute the similar process as well.

</Info>

## Step 5: Execute your test suite with CI

After the setup is completed, you can now execute your test suite with the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline with any tool of your choice.

<Tip>
**GitHub Actions - Example**

If your current pipeline is set to `GitHub Actions` then you can configure your `workflow` to trigger the test suite by committing the changes to the `GitHub Repo` or on raising a `Pull Request` to merge any changes to the branch as per your branch rules.

## GitHub App Feedback State

Here is an example of **Successful** feedback app state:

<Tip>
**Note**

You can click on `Details` link which will redirect the user to the build of the SmartUI test to view the results
