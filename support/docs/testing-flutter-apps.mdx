Google's Flutter is an open-source tool for developing native mobile apps. It enables developers to create cross-platform apps for both Android and iOS using a single codebase and programming language.

You can now test Flutter apps on the <BrandName /> [Appium testing](https://stage.testmuinternal.ai/appium-testing) platform across 3000+ real Android and iOS devices. <BrandName /> supports Appium's Flutter driver that lets you test Flutter apps using the Appium framework. To test Flutter apps, you will need to upload apps on <BrandName /> cloud servers and then run your automated tests. 

## Prerequisites

---

Before automating Flutter apps using Appium, make sure you have the following things configured.

1. Your Flutter App must be compiled in `debug` or `profile` mode, as  Appium Flutter Driver does not support Flutter App running in release mode. 

2. Add the below dependencies in Flutter app's `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
 dev_dependencies:
   test: Demo
   flutter_test:
     sdk: flutter
   flutter_driver:
     sdk: flutter
```

3. In `main.dart` file, ensure the app has `enableFlutterDriverExtension()` enabled before `runApp`.

```dart
void main() {
    enableFlutterDriverExtension();
    init();
    runApp(MyApp());
 }
 ```

 4. Set the `automationName` capability to `flutter` in Appium desired capabilities.

```java
 desiredCapabilities.setCapability("automationName", "flutter");
```

Shown below is the test script for automating Flutter apps on <BrandName /> platform.

```python
import os

from appium.webdriver import Remote
from appium_flutter_finder.flutter_finder import FlutterElement, FlutterFinder

# Example

driver = Remote('http://<LT username>:<LT accesskey>@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub/', dict(
    platformName='Android',
    automationName='flutter',
    platformVersion='11',
    deviceName='Google Pixel 4',
    app='<App URL>',
    isRealMobile=True
))

finder = FlutterFinder()

text_finder = finder.by_text('You have pushed the button this many times:')
text_element = FlutterElement(driver, text_finder)
print(text_element.text)

key_finder = finder.by_value_key("next_route_key")
goto_next_route_element = FlutterElement(driver, key_finder)
print(goto_next_route_element.text)
goto_next_route_element.click()

back_finder = finder.page_back()
back_element = FlutterElement(driver, back_finder)
back_element.click()

tooltip_finder = finder.by_tooltip("Increment")
driver.execute_script('flutter:waitFor', tooltip_finder, 100)

floating_button_element = FlutterElement(driver, tooltip_finder)
floating_button_element.click()

counter_finder = finder.by_value_key("counter")
counter_element = FlutterElement(driver, counter_finder)
print(counter_element.text)
```
