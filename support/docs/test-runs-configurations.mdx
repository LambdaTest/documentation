Configurations in Test Manager allow you to define reusable environment setups for your test runs. You can specify platform, browser, OS, and device combinations once and apply them across multiple test runs.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Centralized Management** - Create, edit, and delete configurations from a single dashboard
- **Reusability** - Apply the same configuration across multiple test runs
- **Multi-Platform Support** - Configure Desktop, Virtual Mobile, and Real Device environments

#### KaneAI-Exclusive Features

The following options are available only for KaneAI-generated test runs:

**Device Type: Private Cloud vs Public Cloud**

For organizations with a private cloud real device plan, you can choose between:
- **Public Cloud** - Shared pool of devices available to all <BrandName /> users
- **Private Cloud** - Dedicated device pool exclusive to your organization

**Multi-Select Support**

KaneAI allows selecting multiple values for Manufacturer, Device, and OS Version. This creates a larger device pool, ensuring test execution can proceed even if specific devices are unavailable.

#### Application Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Auto Update** | Automatically updates the configuration when a new app version (matching `appPackage` or `bundleId`) is uploaded |
| **Custom ID** | Links the configuration to an app uploaded via [API](/support/docs/application-setup-via-api/#upload-your-application) with a specific `custom_id` |
| **Pre-Installed App** | Available for Private Cloud only. Maps app capability to `Stock` for testing pre-installed applications |
