Zebrunner is a modern test reporting and analytics tool which offers very comprehensive automated test results and analysis with the help of a smart AI-based failure classification system. Through Zebrunner, you can easily detect failures with the help of rich artifacts, such as video, screens, logs, etc., and fix issues faster.

Zebrunner now offers integration with <BrandName /> to help you perform automated cross-browser testing taking advantage of the cloud-based Selenium Grid on over 2000 real browsers. <BrandName /> [Selenium Grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/why-selenium-grid-is-ideal-for-automated-browser-testing/) integration to Zebrunner will help you run your Selenium automation scripts from Zebrunner instance to our cloud-based Selenium Grid very easily. Lets see how.

## How To Integrate <BrandName /> With Zebrunner Instance

* * *

To integrate your <BrandName /> account with the Zebrunner instance, go to the Integrations panel and activate the <BrandName /> environment under Test Environment Provider category. <img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/zebrunner-integration/activate-testmu ai.webp' alt="zebrunner integration" width="1282" height="722" />

The <BrandName /> option will open and you will be needed to enter your <BrandName /> credentials, including Hub URL, username and access key. Once you have entered the required information, click on Save button.

As soon as you click on the Save button, your <BrandName /> credentials will be verified. If the credentials verification fails, a red dot will appear against <BrandName />, else a green dot will appear stating that the integration is successful, as shown in the image below.

## How To Execute Tests On <BrandName /> From Zebrunner

* * *

Now that you have integrated <BrandName /> as the Test Environment Provide, you can execute your tests on the <BrandName />'s cloud-based Selenium Grid. To do so:

1.  Select the project of your choice, and choose the environment as <BrandName />, from the list of active test environment providers.
