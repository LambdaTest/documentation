Zebrunner is a modern test reporting and analytics tool which offers very comprehensive automated test results and analysis with the help of a smart AI-based failure classification system. Through Zebrunner, you can easily detect failures with the help of rich artifacts, such as video, screens, logs, etc., and fix issues faster.

Zebrunner now offers integration with Lambdatest to help you perform automated cross-browser testing taking advantage of the cloud-based Selenium Grid on over 2000 real browsers. Lambdatest [Selenium Grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/why-selenium-grid-is-ideal-for-automated-browser-testing/) integration to Zebrunner will help you run your Selenium automation scripts from Zebrunner instance to our cloud-based Selenium Grid very easily. Lets see how.

## How To Integrate Lambdatest With Zebrunner Instance

* * *

To integrate your Lambdatest account with the Zebrunner instance, go to the Integrations panel and activate the Lambdatest environment under Test Environment Provider category. ![zebrunner integration](/assets/images/zebrunner-integration/activate-lambdatest.webp)

The Lambdatest option will open and you will be needed to enter your Lambdatest credentials, including Hub URL, username and access key. Once you have entered the required information, click on Save button.

As soon as you click on the Save button, your Lambdatest credentials will be verified. If the credentials verification fails, a red dot will appear against Lambdatest, else a green dot will appear stating that the integration is successful, as shown in the image below.
