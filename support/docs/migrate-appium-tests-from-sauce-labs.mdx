import { BrandName } from "/snippets/BrandName.mdx";


The online Appium Grid is available on both <BrandName /> and Sauce Labs. Therefore, you can effortlessly migrate your current Appium automation scripts (or suites) from Sauce Labs to <BrandName />.

## Introduction
***

Migrating your current Sauce Labs tests to <BrandName /> requires a few tweaks in your code. In this guide, we'll look at how to leverage <BrandName />'s desired capabilities in your tests, authenticate your test session, and execute tests on our cloud browsers.

### Changes In The Test Script
***

To move from the Sauce Labs to <BrandName />, you need to make some changes to your test suites such as authentication, desired capabilities etc.

### Authentication
***

Firstly, you need to change the authentication in the configuration settings of your test suite. For running tests on <BrandName /> Appium Grid, you need to have a valid user_name and access_key to perform tests on our cloud Grid. In case you don’t have an account on <BrandName />, visit the <BrandName /> signup page and create a new account.

The following are the changes in the parameters:

* Username
* Access Key

You can find the Username and Access Key in the <BrandName /> Profile Section of the Automation Dashboard.

When migrating from Sauce Labs to <BrandName />, you need to make the following changes in the existing code:

1. UserName
2. AccessKey
3. Hub URL
4. Desired Capabilities

Here is a side-by-side comparison of each of the fields that we have highlighted above:

| Property | Type | Sauce Labs | <BrandName /> |
| -------- | -----| ------------ | ---------- |
|    UserName      |   String   |       UserName to access Appium Grid on Sauce Labs       |   UserName to access Appium Grid on <BrandName />         |
|     AccessKey     |     String |      AccessKey to access Appium Grid on Sauce Labs        |   AccessKey to access Appium Grid on <BrandName />         |
|     Hub URL     |   String   |     ondemand.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/wd/hub |     @hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub       |

For a Python-based implementation, here are the changes in the script for the authentication process.

**Sauce Labs**

```python
userName = "SAUCE_USERNAME"
accessKey = "SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY"
```
**<BrandName />**

```python
userName = "LambdaTest_UserName"
accessKey = "LambdaTest_AccessKey"
```
### Changes To The Hub URL
***

Now you have to modify the hub URL in your test suite's configuration settings. The Hub URL is of the String type and specifies the Hub location to which the Appium tests will be routed for execution.

For a Python-based implementation, here are the changes in the script for Hub URL.

**Sauce Labs**

```
@ondemand.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/wd/hub
```

**<BrandName />**

```
@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub
```

### Desired Capability Generator
***

Capabilities generator allows you to specify the desired capabilities (or capabilities), which are configuration options that allow you to specify the following:

1. Device
2. Operating system

You can also select other advanced options available in the <BrandName /> Capabilities Generator.

For the migration, we have taken Java-based Appium tests. Below are the screenshots of the capability generator of Sauce Labs and <BrandName />.

**Sauce Labs**

**<BrandName />**

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/getting-started-app-automation/lt-caps.webp' alt="Image"  width="1366" height="625" />

The comparison of the capabilities generated by Sauce Labs and <BrandName /> capabilities generator:

| Capabilities | Sauce Labs | <BrandName /> |
| -------- | -----| ------------ | 
| Device   |  deviceName |   deviceName    |
| Operating System   |   platformVersion    |  platformVersion |

The following is an overview of the comparison of Desired Capabilities for the Java language:

**Sauce Labs**

```py
# demo.py
caps = {
    caps['platformName'] = 'Android'
    caps['browserName'] = 'Chrome'
    caps['appium:deviceName'] = 'Google Pixel 3a GoogleAPI Emulator'
    caps['appium:platformVersion'] = '11.0'
    caps['sauce:options'] = {}
    caps['sauce:options']['appiumVersion'] = '1.20.2'
}
```

**<BrandName />**

```py
# demo.py
caps = [
    {
        "deviceName": "Google Pixel 3",
        "platformName": "Android",
        "platformVersion": "11",
        "app": "<lt_app_url>",
        "isRealMobile": True,
        "deviceOrientation": "PORTRAIT",
        "build": "Demo",
           },
]
```

## Example: Sauce Labs To <BrandName /> Migration
***

Let's look an example that shows the entire migration process. The test scenario is to open a Wikipedia app that search the term ‘testmu ai’. The following test runs on Google Pixel 3 running Android 11.

**Sauce Labs**
 
```python
#samplewikipedia.py

    _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context

    # Legacy Python that doesn't verify HTTPS certificates by default
    pass
else:
    # Handle target environment that doesn't support HTTPS verification
    ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context

    driver.quit()

# The Thread function takes run_session function and each set of capability from the caps array as an argument to run each session in parallel
for cap in caps:
    Thread(target=run_session, args=(cap,)).start()
```

# The Thread function takes run_session function and each set of capability from the caps array as an argument to run each session in parallel

for cap in caps:
    Thread(target=run_session, args=(cap,)).start()
```
The majority of the implementation, as shown above, remains unchanged. Only changes to the infrastructure are made (i.e. instead of Sauce Labs, the app automation tests would be run on <BrandName />).

Let's analyze what has changed from the implementation point of view.
