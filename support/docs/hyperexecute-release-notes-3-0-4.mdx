## New Capability: `bypassProxyDomains`
You can now use the `bypassProxyDomains` capability to bypass Dedicated Proxy for specific domains. This ensures that local services (e.g., localhost, 127.0.0.1, or internal endpoints) remain accessible during test runs.

Note: `dedicatedProxy: true` must be enabled for this capability to take effect.

<Note>
Visit the [bypassProxyDomains documentation](/support/docs/bypass-proxy-domains/) page to understand this capability in detail.

## Live Command Logs
We’ve improved the way command logs are displayed in the HyperExecute dashboard. Earlier, logs appeared in chunks, which delayed visibility and created a less interactive experience. With the new **Live Command Logs**, you’ll now see logs in real-time as they are generated, giving you instant feedback during test execution.
