## How To Use <BrandName />  Custom Capabilities in Tosca
There are few custom capabilities  like network logs,console logs in <BrandName /> platform to enable Logs on execution.

To use a WebDriver capability,

- Prefix the capability with "WebDriver_"*, for ex: WebDriver_console. 
- If the name of the capability contains a dot (.), replace this character with double underscore (\__). If the name of the capability contains a colon (:), replace this character with triple underscore (___).

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/tosca-integration/tosca_int_26.webp' alt="Image" width="1365" height="650" />

With this enabled log when you execute the test case, you can see logs in <BrandName /> Plateform once execution completes.

## Geolocation Testing in Tosca with <BrandName />

Test the performance of your web-app through different geographic locations by setting LamdaTest Capability "geoLocation". Set this Capability in Tosca as "WebDriver_geoLocation"with Value of "IN"as shows below

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/tosca-integration/tosca_int_27.webp' alt="Image" width="1365" height="650" />

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects
***
To help you perform [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com) of your locally stored web pages, <BrandName /> provides an SSH(Secure Shell) tunnel connection with the name Lambda Tunnel. With Lambda Tunnel, you can execute a test server inside your GitLab CI build a container to perform automated cross browser testing on browsers offered by Selenium grid on <BrandName />. So you make sure how well your changes look, even before your customers.
