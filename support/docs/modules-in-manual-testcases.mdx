To incorporate existing modules into your test steps, simply click on the Modules Icon.

From there, you'll be able to select and import the specific module you need.

<Note>
**Keep in mind that only modules already linked with your project will be available for import.**

Notice that imported modules will appear visually distinct from other individual steps within your test case, making them easy to identify. 

You also have the flexibility to edit or delete these modules directly from this view. However, be aware that making changes will create a new version of that module.

<Note>
**Please note that when a module is updated to a new version, its existing occurrences within your test cases will not be affected. They will remain linked to the previous version. To utilize the latest version of a module, you'll need to manually sync it by clicking the `Sync to latest` button. This allows you to review and confirm changes before they impact your test cases.**
