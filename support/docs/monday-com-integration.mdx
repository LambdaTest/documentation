<Warning>
*   **What is the Site Address?**
</Warning>

When you open any web page, the URL showing in the address window of your web browser is termed as site address. The site address consists of **https://** followed by the domain name of your website.

<Warning>
*   **What is your Personal API token?**
</Warning>

When two different applications interact with each other, server-to-server communication is established. The API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining the security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end-user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end-user logs in an application through a two-step verification process.

**Step 5:** You can find your API token from your respective **monday.com** instance. If you have not generated one before, you can generate an API token by going to the settings from the bottom left corner, near your **avtar image**. After you click on your avatar image, a menu would open up, navigate to **'Admin'** section.
