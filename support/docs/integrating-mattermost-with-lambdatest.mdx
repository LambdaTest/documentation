Mattermost is a Communication platform, written in Golang and React, and is open-source, self-hostable, easy to deploy, manage, and upgrade. It is a secure workplace which allows messaging from behind your firewall. Mattermost is a famous alternative to proprietary SaaS messaging apps, as it allows you to bring all your team communication into a single place, making it anywhere searchable and accessible.

The Lambdatest Mattermost Integration allows you to share or push a bug to your specified Mattermost channel from the Lambdatest platform in a single click. You can share any UI observations and input with your team on Mattermost anytime, by just capturing a screenshot in the middle of your test session through Lambdatest. You can also annotate the screenshot or highlight your issue or input. The fields populated by you while marking as a bug through Lambdatest gets displayed as information on Mattermost for that testing instance.

**Mattermost Integration with Lambdatest, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.**

At the bottom of the form, please make sure to tick the check button  
stating **"Send to Mattermost"**.

<Warning>
Note: By default, it would be **checked**, if Mattermost is already integrated. This button helps send the screenshot, as per the filled form, directly to your workspace, when the Bug is created. You can uncheck the button anytime if you do not wish the bug/task/issue on Mattermost
</Warning>

Now click on **"Create Bug"** button to send the bug directly to Mattermost workspace.

## How To Remove Mattermost Integration?

<Warning>
You can work with one integration at a time. So if you would want to integrate to a similar 3rd party application, then you would have to **remove** your current integration. Here is how you can do that.
