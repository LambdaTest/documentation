## Steps to Automate your Application

**Step 1:** Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the <BrandName /> servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication.

Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

<Tabs className="docs__val" groupId="os">
<Tab title="Linux / MacOS">

```bash

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" --location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' --form 'name="Android_App"' --form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
`}

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">
```powershell

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""`}

```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Step 2 :** Click on the Record Test button.

**Step 3 :** Enter your project name, select project location and select your desired test type. In this demo we are selecting the Javascript. Click on the Next button.

<Info>
**Update your **APP_ID**, **YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME**, and **YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY** while passing the capabilities.**

</Info>

```bash title="Sample code for capabilities"
{
    "platformName": "android",
		"deviceName": "Galaxy s21 5G",
	"lt:options": {
		"w3c": true,
		"platformName": "android",
		"deviceName": "Galaxy s21 5G",
		"platformVersion": "12",
		"isRealMobile": true,
                 "app":"<APP_ID>",
                 "user":"YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME",
                 "accessKey":"YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
	}
}
```

**Step 6 :** Now whatever steps you will perform in the application will get recorded. Click on the stop button when you are completed with your testing.
