You can download or clone the sample GitHub project from the following repo - [Cypress-<BrandName />-Applitools-Integration](https://github.com/gaurav8760/Cypress-<BrandName />-Applitools-Integration). Navigate to your project directory and follow these steps:

- Install the **NPM dependencies** using the below command:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Set up **Applitools Eyes** using the below command:

  ```bash
  npx eyes-setup
  ```

## Setting up <BrandName /> CLI and Dependencies

---

- Install the <BrandName /> CLI using below command:

  ```bash
  npm install -g lambdatest-cypress-cli
  ```

- Setup configurations on which you want to run your test using the below command:

  ```bash
  lambdatest-cypress init
  ```

## Running The Sample Project

---

Execute your first test case using the below command:

```bash
lambdatest-cypress run
```

<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/applitools-cypress/applitools3.webp" alt="Image" width="1353" height="622"/>

---
<Warning>
The first test case that you execute will be considered as the base image by default by Applitools.
</Warning>
<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/applitools-cypress/applitools4.webp' alt="Image" width="1353" height="622"/>

---

Edit the URL in the `applitoolsIntegration.spec.js` file and run your second test by using the same run command.

<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/applitools-cypress/applitools5.webp" alt="Image" width="1353" height="622"/>

---

Applitools will compare the base image with this test and highlight the difference.
