In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run tests using **Java** on <BrandName />'s [Selenium testing cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation).

## Objectives

---

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **Java** with Selenium.
2. Specify which browsers to perform **Java** automation testing on.
3. Test your locally hosted pages on <BrandName /> platform.
4. Explore advanced features of <BrandName />.

## Prerequisites

---

Before you can start performing Java automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

- Install the latest **Java development environment**. We recommend to use **Java 11** version.

- Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from [the official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your automation script on <BrandName /> Selenium cloud grid.

- Setup your environment with required Selenium bindings if you are using an IDE for running the tests. These are the steps required to configure your IDE :

  - **Step 1:** Download the latest Java Selenium Bindings from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) and extract the **ZIP** file to your project directory.
  - **Step 2:** Create a new Java project and once it's created, you can open the project settings. Here we are showing an example for the same in **IntelliJ IDEA CE**.
    <img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/selenium/java1.png' alt="cmd" width="1260" height="1071"/>

  - **Step 3:** Navigate to **dependencies** in module settings where you can add your external JARs.
  - **Step 4:** Under dependencies by clicking the **`+`** icon, you can add your downloaded **Selenium JARs** to the project. Once they are added, it should look like this :
    <img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/selenium/java2.png' alt="cmd" width="1150" height="740"/>

Now you are good to run the Java automation testing scripts.

## Run Your First Test

---

Let’s start with a simple Selenium Remote WebDriver test first. The Java script below tests a simple to-do application with basic functionalities like mark items as done, add items in a list, calculate total pending items etc.

### Sample Test with Java

```java JavaToDo.java
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.net.URL;
import org.openqa.selenium.By;
import org.openqa.selenium.JavascriptExecutor;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities;
import org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver;
public class JavaTodo {
    String username = "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME";
    String accesskey = "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY";
    static RemoteWebDriver driver = null;
    String gridURL = "@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub";
    boolean status = false;
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new JavaTodo().test();
    }
    public void test() {
        // To Setup driver
        setUp();
        try {
              //Change it to production page
            driver.get("https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/");

              //Let's mark done first two items in the list.
              driver.findElement(By.name("li1")).click();
            driver.findElement(By.name("li2")).click();

             // Let's add an item in the list.
              driver.findElement(By.id("sampletodotext")).sendKeys("Yey, Let's add it to list");
            driver.findElement(By.id("addbutton")).click();

              // Let's check that the item we added is added in the list.
            String enteredText = driver.findElementByXPath("/html/body/div/div/div/ul/li[6]/span").getText();
            if (enteredText.equals("Yey, Let's add it to list")) {
                status = true;
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            tearDown();
        }
    }
    private void setUp() {
        DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("browserName", "chrome");
        capabilities.setCapability("version", "70.0");
        capabilities.setCapability("platform", "win10"); // If this cap isn't specified, it will just get any available one.
        capabilities.setCapability("build", "LambdaTestSampleApp");
        capabilities.setCapability("name", "LambdaTestJavaSample");
        try {
            driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("https://" + username + ":" + accesskey + gridURL), capabilities);
        } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
            System.out.println("Invalid grid URL");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    private void tearDown() {
        if (driver != null) {
            ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("lambda-status=" + status);
            driver.quit(); //really important statement for preventing your test execution from a timeout.
        }
    }
}
```

**Step 1:** Once you setup your environment with the latest Java Selenium bindings, create a new java file `<file_name>.java` in your current project or testing directory and add the above code snippet.

### Setting up your Authentication

Make sure you have your <BrandName /> credentials with you to run test automation scripts on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [<BrandName /> Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [<BrandName /> Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 2:** Please edit and add your **UserName** and **AccessKey** which are generated from the platform in your `<file_name>.java` file:


  ```Java
  String username= "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"; 
String accesskey= "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY";
  ```


### Configuring your Test Capabilities

**Step 3:** In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with <BrandName /> Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code is defined as:

```java
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("browserName", "chrome");
        capabilities.setCapability("version", "70.0");
        capabilities.setCapability("platform", "win10"); // If this cap isn't specified, it will just get the any available one
        capabilities.setCapability("build", "LambdaTestSampleApp");
        capabilities.setCapability("name", "LambdaTestJavaSample");
```

<Note>
You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt 🔗 **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.

</Note> 

### Executing the Test

- If you are using an editor or IDE for running your tests, you can just build and run your configured java file in your editor/IDE.
- If you are using a terminal/cmd, you would need to execute the following commands :

```bash
cd to/file/location
#Compile the test file:
javac -classpath ".:/path/to/selenium/jarfile:" <file_name>.java
#Run the test:
java -classpath ".:/path/to/selenium/jarfile:" <file_name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
cd /Users/macuser/Documents/LambdaTest_Java
javac -classpath ".:/Users/macuser/Documents/LambdaTest_Java/selenium-server-4.1.1.jar:" JavaTodo.java
java -classpath ".:/Users/macuser/Documents/LambdaTest_Java/selenium-server-4.1.1.jar:" JavaTodo
```

<Note>
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [<BrandName /> automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build). <BrandName /> Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

</Note>

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

---

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [<BrandName /> Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using <BrandName /> Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using <BrandName /> Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. <BrandName /> Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

<Check>
**TUNNEL HELP**

Refer our 🔗 [<BrandName /> Tunnel documentation](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

</Check>

Here’s how you can establish <BrandName /> Tunnel.

<Note> 
**DOWNLOAD THE BINARY FILE**

- [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
- [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
- [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

</Note> 

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
./LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```

So if your user name is **lambdatest@example.com**, the command would be:


  ```bash
  ./LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
  ```


Once you are able to connect **<BrandName /> Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code as shown:

```java Tunnel Capability
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
        capabilities.setCapability("tunnel", true);
```
