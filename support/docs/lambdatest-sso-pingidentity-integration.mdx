<BrandName /> provides seamless integration with Ping Identity through SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for your organization. By integrating Ping Identity with your <BrandName /> organization, you can streamline user authentication and enhance security.

## Key Features of Ping Identity Integration:
- **SP-Initiated SSO :** Single Sign-On initiated from the <BrandName /> platform.
- **IdP-Initiated SSO :** Single Sign-On initiated from Ping Identity.

## Prerequisites
Before configuring the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **<BrandName /> Enterprise Plan :** Your organization must have an active Enterprise plan.
- **SSO Enablement Request :** The admin of your <BrandName /> organization must request SSO enablement.

<Warning> Raise a request via email at support@testmu.ai or through <BrandName />’s 24/7 in-app chat support.</Warning>

- **Ping Identity Admin Access :** You need administrative access to your Ping Identity account.

## Configuring <BrandName /> & Ping Identity Integration
Follow the steps below to configure the SAML-based integration between <BrandName /> and Ping Identity.

### Step 1: Log in to Ping Identity

### Step 6 : Upload Metadata URL & SSO Domain
- SSO Domains (Comma-separated list of the domains that can be authenticated in the Identity Provider.)
- Copy the **IDP Metadata URL** from PingIdentity

- Go back to <BrandName /> and paste the copied URL in the **Issuer URL** field and click on **Create Connection**:
  ![sso-self serve](/assets/images/sso/ping-identity/issuer-url.png)

After completing these configurations, your <BrandName /> and Ping Identity integration for SSO will be ready to use. Both SP-initiated and IdP-initiated SSO flows will be enabled, and you can manage users and groups via Ping Identity.
