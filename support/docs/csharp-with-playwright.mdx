Learn how to use Playwright with C# to automate web application testing across 50+ real browsers and operating systems on LambdaTest cloud platform.


## Prerequisites
---

1. You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Check>
**SAMPLE REPO**

Download or clone the code sample for the Playwright C# from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests.

<GitHubButton url="https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample/tree/main/playwright-csharp" />
</Check>

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
cd playwright-csharp
```

2. Install the npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. A LambdaTest Username and Access key. You can get it from your LambdaTest Profile section. Don't have an account, [sign up for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).

4. To run Playwright tests, set your LambdaTest Username and Access key in the Environment Variables.

## Run your Playwright tests with C#
---

Navigate to the `PlaywrightTestSingle.cs` file in the `playwright-csharp` directory.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Playwright;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

class PlaywrightTestSingle
{
    public static async Task main(string[] args)
    {
        using var playwright = await Playwright.CreateAsync();

        string user, accessKey;
        user = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_USERNAME");
        accessKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LT_ACCESS_KEY");

        Dictionary<string, object> capabilities = new Dictionary<string, object>();
        Dictionary<string, string> ltOptions = new Dictionary<string, string>();

        ltOptions.Add("name", "Playwright Test");
        ltOptions.Add("build", "Playwright C-Sharp tests");
        ltOptions.Add("platform", "Windows 10");
        ltOptions.Add("user", user);
        ltOptions.Add("accessKey", accessKey);

        capabilities.Add("browserName", "Chrome");
        capabilities.Add("browserVersion", "latest");
        capabilities.Add("LT:Options", ltOptions);

        string capabilitiesJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(capabilities);

        string cdpUrl = "wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=" + Uri.EscapeDataString(capabilitiesJson);

        await using var browser = await playwright.Chromium.ConnectAsync(cdpUrl);
        var page = await browser.NewPageAsync();
        try {
          await page.GotoAsync("https://www.bing.com");
          await page.Locator("[aria-label='Enter your search term']").ClickAsync();
          await page.FillAsync("[aria-label='Enter your search term']", "LambdaTest");
          await page.Keyboard.PressAsync("Enter");
          var title = await page.TitleAsync();

          if (title.Contains("LambdaTest"))
          {
            // Use the following code to mark the test status.
            await SetTestStatus("passed", "Title matched", page);
          }
          else {
            await SetTestStatus("failed", "Title not matched", page);
          }
        }
        catch (Exception err) {
          await SetTestStatus("failed", err.Message, page);
        }
        await browser.CloseAsync();
    }

    public static async Task SetTestStatus(string status, string remark, IPage page) {
        await page.EvaluateAsync("_ => {}", "lambdatest_action: {\"action\": \"setTestStatus\", \"arguments\": {\"status\":\"" + status + "\", \"remark\": \"" + remark + "\"}}");
    }
}
```

1. Pass the below command in the terminal:

```js
dotnet build
```

2. To run the test, pass the below command:

```js
dotnet run single
```

**Note**: To run sessions on custom devices with emulation, run `dotnet run iphonetest` or `dotnet run ipadtest`.
