import { BrandName } from "/snippets/BrandName.mdx";


<BrandName /> allows you to integrate an external user directory with your <BrandName /> Organization through an IDP so your team could leverage the Single Sign-on setup. With Okta, you can integrate your <BrandName /> organization in two ways i.e. through the Dev Console or the SAML.

After you integrate your Okta instance with your <BrandName /> for Single Sign-on, you can benefit from the following features:
* SP-initiated SSO.
* IdP-initiated SSO.

To know more, refer to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Reference/glossary.htm">Okta's glossary</a>.

## Prerequisites
To enable <BrandName /> SSO through Okta integration:

* You will need an Enterprise plan with <BrandName />.
* The Admin of your <BrandName /> organization needs to raise a request for enabling SSO Self Serve UI. They could drop us an email over <a href="mailto:support@testmuai.com">support@testmuai.com</a> or could reach out to us via our <span className="doc__lt" onClick={() => window.openLTChatWidget()}>**24/7 in app chat support**</span>.
* You will also need the admin level access of Okta  to configure the SSO.
