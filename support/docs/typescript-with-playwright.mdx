Learn how to use Playwright with TypeScript to automate web application testing across 50+ real browsers and operating systems on LambdaTest cloud platform.


## Prerequisites
---

1. You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Check>
**SAMPLE REPO**

Download or clone the code sample for the Playwright TypeScript from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests.

<GitHubButton url="https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample/tree/main/playwright-test-ts" />
</Check>

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
cd playwright-test-ts
```

2. Install the npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. A LambdaTest Username and Access key. You can get it from your LambdaTest Profile section. Don't have an account, [sign up for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).

4. To run Playwright tests, set your LambdaTest Username and Access key in the Environment Variables.

## Run your Playwright tests with TypeScript
---

Navigate to the `lambdatest-setup.ts` file in the `playwright-test-ts` directory.

```js
/**
 * Add the file in your test suite to run tests on LambdaTest.
 * Import `test` object from this file in the tests.
 */

import * as base from "@playwright/test";
import path from "path";
import { chromium } from "playwright";

// LambdaTest capabilities
const capabilities = {
  browserName: "Chrome", // Browsers allowed: `Chrome`, `MicrosoftEdge`, `pw-chromium`, `pw-firefox` and `pw-webkit`
  browserVersion: "latest",
  "LT:Options": {
    platform: "Windows 10",
    build: "Playwright TypeScript Build",
    name: "Playwright TypeScript Test",
    user: process.env.LT_USERNAME,
    accessKey: process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY,
    network: true,
    video: true,
    console: true,
    tunnel: false, // Add tunnel configuration if testing locally hosted webpage
    tunnelName: "", // Optional
    geoLocation: '', // country code can be fetched from https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/
  },
};

// Patching the capabilities dynamically according to the project name.
const modifyCapabilities = (configName, testName) => {
  let config = configName.split("@lambdatest")[0];
  let [browserName, browserVersion, platform] = config.split(":");
  capabilities.browserName = browserName
    ? browserName
    : capabilities.browserName;
  capabilities.browserVersion = browserVersion
    ? browserVersion
    : capabilities.browserVersion;
  capabilities["LT:Options"]["platform"] = platform
    ? platform
    : capabilities["LT:Options"]["platform"];
  capabilities["LT:Options"]["name"] = testName;
};

const getErrorMessage = (obj, keys) =>
  keys.reduce(
    (obj, key) => (typeof obj == "object" ? obj[key] : undefined),
    obj
  );

const test = base.test.extend({
  page: async ({ page, playwright }, use, testInfo) => {
    // Configure LambdaTest platform for cross-browser testing
    let fileName = testInfo.file.split(path.sep).pop();
    if (testInfo.project.name.match(/lambdatest/)) {
      modifyCapabilities(
        testInfo.project.name,
        `${testInfo.title} - ${fileName}`
      );

      const browser = await chromium.connect({
        wsEndpoint: `wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=${encodeURIComponent(
          JSON.stringify(capabilities)
        )}`,
      });

      const ltPage = await browser.newPage(testInfo.project.use);
      await use(ltPage);

      const testStatus = {
        action: "setTestStatus",
        arguments: {
          status: testInfo.status,
          remark: getErrorMessage(testInfo, ["error", "message"]),
        },
      };
      await ltPage.evaluate(() => {},
      `lambdatest_action: ${JSON.stringify(testStatus)}`);
      await ltPage.close();
      await browser.close();
    } else {
      // Run tests in local in case of local config provided
      await use(page);
    }
  },
});

export default test;
```

Pass the below command in the terminal to run the test.

```js
npm run test
```
