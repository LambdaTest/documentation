<BrandName /> supports a **credit management system** as an add‑on over your active subscriptions for <BrandName /> products. Many products include additional **AI features** that are powered by credits. This guide explains how credits work, how to view usage, and how admins can control consumption.

---

## Who gets credits?

* **Free users:** Receive **1,000 complimentary credits** to try AI‑powered features.
* **Paid users:** Receive **complimentary credits** based on subscription to try AI‑powered features and can purchase credits as an add‑on at any time. Credits are used only when AI features are invoked.

<Tip>
**Once free credits are exhausted, AI features will be unavailable until you **upgrade or purchase credits** from the Billing page. Use this link to buy credits directly: [Upgrade / Buy Credits](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/subscriptions?addCredits=true).**

</Tip>

## View your current credit balance

If you are an **admin** in <BrandName /> organization, you can see the current credits and subscription details in [Billing & Subscriptions](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/subscriptions).

---

## View credit transactions

**Admins** can view detailed **debits and credits** for your organization - **[Transactions view](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/subscriptions?viewCredits=true)**.

The transactions table shows:

* **Date** of the event
* **Type** (Debit / Credit)
* **Credits** (Amount of credits)
* **Name** of the user who did the transaction

---

## Set credit usage limits (Admins Only)

Admins can define **org‑wide controls** to prevent unexpected consumption:

* **Soft Limit**
  When the soft limit is reached, users are **notified via email**, but usage **continues**.

* **Hard Limit**
  When the hard limit is reached, **no further credit consumption** is allowed. Users are notified via email. To resume, increase the limit or purchase more credits.

<Tip>
****Recommendation:** Start with a soft limit (e.g., 70–80% of your monthly plan) and a hard limit (e.g., 90%).**

## AI features that consume credits

Below are the currently supported features and how they consume credits.

### SmartUI Visual AI

<BrandName /> **SmartUI Visual AI** simulates human perception for visual regression. Rather than flagging every pixel change, it highlights **meaningful, human‑relevant** differences between baseline and new screenshots. [Learn more](/support/docs/smartui-visual-ai/).

#### How credits are consumed?

**Small / Normal Screenshot**

* A page or screen that fits within a typical device viewport (e.g., one laptop or mobile screen)
* Examples: login page, product details, simple dashboard
* **Consumes \~1–4 credits** (most common)

**Large Screenshot**
* A long or content‑heavy page beyond the standard viewport (full‑page scroll, data‑heavy dashboards)
* Examples: full home page, long reports, multi‑section dashboards
* **Consumes \~5–8 credits** (less common)

**In summary:** The bigger and more content‑heavy the screenshot, the more credits it consumes.

### AI Test Case Generator

The **AI Test Case Generator** converts diverse inputs (text, PDFs, audio, videos, images, Jira tickets, and more) into **structured, contextual test cases**, accelerating authoring while improving coverage. [Learn more](/support/docs/generate-test-cases-with-ai/).

#### How credits are consumed

* **10 credits per scenario** generated.
* When you start generation, credits are tentatively consumed based on **Max Scenarios** you select (default **5**).
  Example: Default 5 → **50 credits** tentatively consumed when you begin.
* If fewer scenarios are produced (e.g., **4**), **10 credits are credited back**, so you only pay for what’s actually generated.
* **Regeneration** also consumes credits at **10 credits per scenario**.

>This ensures fair usage—you are charged only for **actual output** produced by the AI.
