## Git Token Support & Git Validation Improvements in HyperExecute Projects
We’ve enhanced Projects in HyperExecute to streamline Git integration. You can now also provide a `git_token` instead of PAT Token during project creation for GitHub authentication. If a token isn’t provided at request time, HyperExecute will resolve it in the following order:
- Request-level token
- User-level secret
- Organization-level secret

You can now integrate Enterprise GitHub accounts seamlessly into Projects.
