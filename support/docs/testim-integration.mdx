## Configuring the Capabilities
Include the capabilities you wish to use in a `.json` file and ensure this file is located in the same directory as your Testim runner.

```json
{
  "resolution": "1280x800",
  "browserName": "chrome",
  "version": "latest"
}
```

## Running the Testim Tests on Lambdatest
To execute the tests, check:

* If the Testim CLI is not already installed on your system, use the entire command provided by the Testim CLI or dashboard. 

**For example:**
```json
npm i -g @testim/testim-cli && testim --token "2jWxWxXcmJRON0PA73YZWt92fFGU76cd" --project "GTJL28fMHad" --grid "LAMBDA-TEST" --test-id "2u8QnIm454" --selenium-caps-file "local.json"
```

* If the Testim CLI is already installed, you can run a simpler command that includes your Testim token, project ID, grid, test ID, and the name of your Selenium capabilities file.

**For example:**

```json
testim --token "2jWxWxXcmJRON0PA73YZWt92fFGU76cd" --project "GTJL28fMHad" --grid "LAMBDA-TEST" --test-id "2u8QnIm454" --selenium-caps-file "local.json"
```

To view your test results, navigate to the Lambdatest Web Automation Dashboard.
