## Running First Test From Your TestingWhiz App On Your Lambdatest Account

* * *

Consider a test scenario which includes:

```javascript
- Opening [LambdaTest ToDo App](https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/)
- Check first item in the list
- Check second item in the list
- Add a new item in the list
```

In TestingWhiz, record your test scenario. Once done, click on the Execute button. ![recording test scenario in testingwhiz app](/assets/images/uploads/testingwhiz.webp)

As soon as you do, an automation test will start instantly, and you can view its build running directly on your Lambdatest automation dashboard. Once the test is complete, you can view the result of the test on Lambdatest, with all its details, as shown in the image below: ![Lambdatest Automation Logs](/assets/images/uploads/testingwhiz-6.webp)

You can view logs, [mark bugs](/support/docs/mark-as-bug-in-automation-testing/), and do much more for each executed test from your Lambdatest platform.
