## Running First Test From Your TestingWhiz App On Your <BrandName /> Account

* * *

Consider a test scenario which includes:

```javascript
- Opening [TestMu AI ToDo App](https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/)
- Check first item in the list
- Check second item in the list
- Add a new item in the list
```

In TestingWhiz, record your test scenario. Once done, click on the Execute button. <img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/uploads/testingwhiz.webp' alt="recording test scenario in testingwhiz app" width="1281" height="684" />

As soon as you do, an automation test will start instantly, and you can view its build running directly on your <BrandName /> automation dashboard. Once the test is complete, you can view the result of the test on <BrandName />, with all its details, as shown in the image below: <img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/uploads/testingwhiz-6.webp' alt="<BrandName /> Automation Logs" width="1281" height="582" />
