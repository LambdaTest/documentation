## Testing With Playwright Test When Migrating To <BrandName />
***

If you are migrating test suites to <BrandName />, then follow the below steps.

1. Add the `testmu ai-setup.js` to your project route.

2. Include the `playwright.config.js` in your project in the below format.

```js
const { devices } = require('@playwright/test')

// Playwright config to run tests on TestMu AI platform and local
const config = {
  testDir: 'tests',
  testMatch: '**/*.spec.js',
  timeout: 60000,
  use: {
    viewport: null
  },
  projects: [
    // -- TestMu AI Config --
    // name in the format: browserName:browserVersion:platform@testmu ai
    // Browsers allowed: `Chrome`, `MicrosoftEdge`, `pw-chromium`, `pw-firefox` and `pw-webkit`
    // Use additional configuration options provided by Playwright if required: https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig
    {
      name: 'chrome:latest:MacOS Catalina@testmu ai',
      use: {
        viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'chrome:latest:Windows 10@testmu ai',
      use: {
        viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 }
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'MicrosoftEdge:90:Windows 10@testmu ai',
      use: {
        ...devices['iPhone 12 Pro Max']
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'pw-firefox:latest:Windows 10@testmu ai',
      use: {
        viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 }
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'pw-webkit:latest:Windows 10@testmu ai',
      use: {
        viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }
      }
    }

  ]
}

```

3. Add your test script path in `playwright.config.js`.

4. Import the test object from `testmu ai-setup.js` and run your tests.

```js
const { test } = require('../testmu ai-setup')
const { expect } = require('@playwright/test')

test.describe('Browse TestMu AI in different search engines', () => {
  test('Search TestMu AI on Bing', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('https://www.bing.com')
    const element = await page.$('[aria-label="Enter your search term"]')
    await element.click()
    await element.type('TestMu AI')
    await element.press('Enter')
    const title = await page.title()

    console.log('Page title:: ', title)
    // Use the expect API for assertions provided by playwright
    expect(title).toEqual(expect.stringContaining('TestMu AI'))
  })
})
```
