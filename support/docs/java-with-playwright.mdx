Learn how to use Playwright with Java to automate web application testing across 50+ real browsers and operating systems on LambdaTest cloud platform.

## Prerequisites
---

1. You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Check>
**SAMPLE REPO**

Download or clone the code sample for the Playwright Java from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests.

<GitHubButton url="https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample/tree/main/playwright-java" />
</Check>

```js
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample.git
cd playwright-sample
cd playwright-java
```

2. Install the npm dependencies.

```
npm install
```

3. A LambdaTest Username and Access key. You can get it from your LambdaTest Profile section. Don't have an account, [sign up for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).

4. To run Playwright tests, set your LambdaTest Username and Access key in the Environment Variables.


## Run your Playwright tests with Java
---

Navigate to the `PlaywrightTestSingle.java` file.

```java
package com.lambdatest;

import com.google.gson.JsonObject;
import com.microsoft.playwright.*;

import java.net.URLEncoder;

public class PlaywrightTestSingle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
            JsonObject capabilities = new JsonObject();
            JsonObject ltOptions = new JsonObject();

            String user = System.getenv("LT_USERNAME");
            String accessKey = System.getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY");

            capabilities.addProperty("browsername", "Chrome"); // Browsers allowed: `Chrome`, `MicrosoftEdge`, `pw-chromium`, `pw-firefox` and `pw-webkit`
            capabilities.addProperty("browserVersion", "latest");
            ltOptions.addProperty("platform", "Windows 10");
            ltOptions.addProperty("name", "Playwright Test");
            ltOptions.addProperty("build", "Playwright Testing in Java");
            ltOptions.addProperty("user", user);
            ltOptions.addProperty("accessKey", accessKey);
            capabilities.add("LT:Options", ltOptions);

            BrowserType chromium = playwright.chromium();
            String caps = URLEncoder.encode(capabilities.toString(), "utf-8");
            String cdpUrl = "wss://cdp.lambdatest.com/playwright?capabilities=" + capabilities;
            Browser browser = chromium.connect(cdpUrl);
            Page page = browser.newPage();
            try {
                page.navigate("https://www.duckduckgo.com");
                Locator locator = page.locator("#search_form_input_homepage");
                locator.click();
                page.fill("#search_form_input_homepage", "LambdaTest");
                page.keyboard().press("Enter");
                String title = page.title();

                if (title.equals("LambdaTest at DuckDuckGo")) {
                    // Use the following code to mark the test status.
                    setTestStatus("passed", "Title matched", page);
                } else {
                    setTestStatus("failed", "Title not matched", page);
                }

            } catch (Exception err) {
                setTestStatus("failed", err.getMessage(), page);
                err.printStackTrace();
            }
            browser.close();
        } catch (Exception err) {
            err.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void setTestStatus(String status, String remark, Page page) {
        Object result;
        result = page.evaluate("_ => {}", "lambdatest_action: { \"action\": \"setTestStatus\", \"arguments\": { \"status\": \"" + status + "\", \"remark\": \"" + remark + "\"}}");
    }
}
```

Pass the below command in the terminal to run the test.

```java
mvn -Dexec.mainClass="com.lambdatest.PlaywrightTestSingle" -Dexec.classpathScope=test test-compile exec:java
```
