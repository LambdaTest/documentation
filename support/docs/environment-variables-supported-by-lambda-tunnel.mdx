You can leverage these environment variables to define your proxy settings. If these proxy environment variables are set then the tunnel will automatically detect them. You can switch command-line flags through an environment variable or <b>.lt.yaml</b>==$0 file with the <BrandName /> tunnel.
To configure the <b>.lt.yaml</b>, you can refer to the section [Leverage .lt.yaml file](/support/docs/advanced-tunnel-features/#leverage-ltyaml-file) of the documentation [Advanced <BrandName /> Tunnel Features](/support/docs/advanced-tunnel-features/).

### What are Environment Variables?

---

Environment variables can be used in place of command-line flags. Each operating system has its compatibility in terms of environment variables. Command-line flags restrict environment variables from being bypassed. When available, the command-line flags always take priority.

Below is the following list of environment variables used by the <BrandName /> Tunnel
