## How To Use <BrandName />  Custom Capabilities in Tosca
There are few custom capabilities  like network logs,console logs in <BrandName /> platform to enable Logs on execution.

To use a WebDriver capability,

- Prefix the capability with "WebDriver_"*, for ex: WebDriver_console. 
- If the name of the capability contains a dot (.), replace this character with double underscore (\__). If the name of the capability contains a colon (:), replace this character with triple underscore (___).

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects
***
To help you perform [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com) of your locally stored web pages, <BrandName /> provides an SSH(Secure Shell) tunnel connection with the name Lambda Tunnel. With Lambda Tunnel, you can execute a test server inside your GitLab CI build a container to perform automated cross browser testing on browsers offered by Selenium grid on <BrandName />. So you make sure how well your changes look, even before your customers.
