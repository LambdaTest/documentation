Azure Pipelines, by Microsoft, is a feature of Azure DevOps. It helps to automatically build, test, and deploy your projects, with Continuous Integration or CI, upon various production environments. So your Selenium automation test scripts can run successfully on Azure Pipeline. However, sometimes running your scripts can be a bit tedious. This is where the Lambdatest plugin can be used in the Azure Pipeline to ease the workflow and automate the tests. Lambdatest allows you to perform live interactive and automated cross-browser testing on 3000+ real browsers and operating systems online.

**Step 8:** Add a new task in the job with the help of **+** button, and fill the required details. 

![azure pipeline](/assets/images/uploads/Step-6.webp) For this demo purpose, we have used following tasks:

* Search *Lambdatest* in the search menu, and select **Lambdatest Configuration Setup**, **Stop Tunnel**, and **Lambdatest Results** from the available tasks. 

![azure pipeline](/assets/images/uploads/search-lambdatest.webp)

*   Similarly, add **Command Line Script** and **Python Script** in to this job.
*   Once added, arrange the tasks in below shown order: 

![azure pipeline](/assets/images/uploads/arrange.webp)

**Step 9:** Click on **Lambdatest Configuration Setup** and then click on **New**.

![azure pipeline](/assets/images/uploads/configuration-setup.webp)

**Step 10:** Fill the required details. For this demo purpose, we have used following details:

* Select Basic Authentication mode of integration from the given authentication methods.
* Enter your Lambdatest username as "Username" and Lambdatest Access Key as "Password" and then click on     verify button.
* Enter the desired Service connection name in the Details section and then click Verify and Save button.

    ![azure pipeline](/assets/images/uploads/verify-save.webp)

**Note**: You can also activate the Lambdatest Tunnel for localhost testing. Just select Service connection from the drop down list and Select Lambdatest Tunnel.

**Step 11:** Now we need to install Selenium in our job to perform the automation tests. Click on Command Line Script and enter the command `pip install selenium` to install Selenium:

![azure pipeline](/assets/images/uploads/pip.webp)

**Step 12:** Select **Run a Python script** as we have selected Python in the above steps.

![azure pipeline](/assets/images/uploads/python.webp)

Select your script to execute either from your repository using the "File Path" option, or you can also write the script inline using the "Inline" option. Once the script is ready, click on "OK"

**Note**: In order to run the tests, you will need to get your build name from the environment variables. Shown below is the syntax of getting the build name from the environment variables for Python test scripts.

```py
build_name = os.getenv("LT_BUILD_NAME")
```

**Step 13:** Now we have imported everything to run our tests. Click on "Save & Queue" to run your test.

![azure pipeline](/assets/images/uploads/save-queue.webp)

**Step 14:** Select OS from Agent Specification as shown below and click "Save and Run".

Not only this, but you can also use this automation dashboard to obtain Test logs, Analytics, Mark Bugs, Integrate apps from our diverse app store, fetch build details, and much more. Lambdatest Selenium Automation Grid enables you to perform end-to-end automation tests on a secure, reliable, and scalable Selenium infrastructure. You can perform automated cross-browser testing with Selenium scripts on 3000+ browsers and operating systems environments giving you higher test coverage and at significantly less built times. Lambdatest will help you evaluate how well your web application renders when accessed through a variety of different browsers. You can perform automated cross-browser testing of your locally hosted web pages using Lambdatest Tunnel. You could also run a single test across multiple browser/OS configurations, simultaneously.

## LocalHost Testing Using Lambdatest Extension

* * *

Lambdatest extension also allows you to perform testing of your localhost project securely with the [Lambdatest Tunnel](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) help. The below steps will help you configure the Lambdatest Tunnel using the Lambdatest extension in your Azure Pipelines:

### Starting The Lambdatest Tunnel Using Lambdatest Extension

While configuring the Lambdatest Configuration Setup job, as shown above, check the Lambdatest Tunnel checkbox to activate it.

Once you activate it, a Lambdatest Tunnel Options box will appear, which require the [modifiers/arguments](/support/docs/lambda-tunnel-modifiers/) to configure the tunnel as per requirement. Pass the Lambdatest Tunnel modifiers in JSON format in the options box.

<Warning>
Note: Make sure to use the camel case for passing the tunnel modifiers. For example, use sharedTunnel if you want to use the modifier --shared-tunnel. For our demo purpose, we will be using simple modifiers, such as --tunnel-name and --proxy-port: &lbrace;"tunnelName":"azure tunnel", "proxyPort":8050&rbrace;
</Warning>

The Lambdatest Tunnel has been successfully configured now. You can test your locally hosted pages and privately hosted pages at the Lambdatest Platform using Lambdatest Tunnel.

### Stopping The Lambdatest Tunnel Using LambaTest Extension

To stop the Lambdatest Tunnel, you need to add the _Lambdatest Stop Tunnel_ task in your job. Once this task is executed, the Lambdatest Tunnel will stop successfully.

![azure pipeline](/assets/images/uploads/LT-ext-4-1024x528.webp)

You must keep this task at the end of your all tests, to let your tests execute successfully before stopping the Lambdatest Tunnel.

To setup your azure pipeline using Lambdatest Azure Pipeline Extension, you can refer to the below example:

```
resources:
  repositories:
  - repository: self
    type: git
    ref: refs/heads/main
jobs:
- job: Job_1
  displayName: Agent job 1
  pool:
    vmImage: windows-2019
  steps:
  - checkout: self
    clean: true
    fetchTags: false
  - task: Lambdatest.lambda-azure-pipeline-extention.configuration-task.configuration@1
    displayName: LambdaTest configuration setup
    inputs:
      connection: 'connect endpoint'  // provide your connection name
      isTunnelActivate: true
      isAppAutomate: false // set true if you want to run your app automate test scripts

  - task: PythonScript@0
    displayName: Run a Python script
    inputs:
      scriptSource: inline
      script: >-
        print('Hello world') // provide your python script or command to run your test scripts

  - task: Lambdatest.lambda-azure-pipeline-extention.stopLambdaTunnel-task.stoptunnel@1
    displayName: LambdaTest Stop Tunnel
  - task: Lambdatest.lambda-azure-pipeline-extention.showResults-task.LambdatestResults@1
    displayName: Lambdatest Results
...
```
Also you may use the YAMl assistant to add your tasks in the pipeline YAML file
