# Integrate <BrandName /> Extension With Azure Pipelines

* * *

Azure Pipelines, by Microsoft, is a feature of Azure DevOps. It helps to automatically build, test, and deploy your projects, with Continuous Integration or CI, upon various production environments. So your Selenium automation test scripts can run successfully on Azure Pipeline. However, sometimes running your scripts can be a bit tedious. This is where the <BrandName /> plugin can be used in the Azure Pipeline to ease the workflow and automate the tests. <BrandName /> allows you to perform live interactive and automated cross-browser testing on 3000+ real browsers and operating systems online.

## How To Find Test Execution Results On <BrandName />

* * *

The output of the tests executed above can be seen in your authenticated <BrandName /> account as well. Follow the below steps to see your test execution result:

**Step 1:** Login into your <BrandName /> account using the credentials used above in the Azure Pipelines.

**Step 2:** Go to "Automations" tab from your left menu.

**Step 3:** Here you can see the executed tests along with their builds, details and status, as shown below:

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/uploads/Step-17.webp' alt="azure pipeline" width="768" height="345" />

Not only this, but you can also use this automation dashboard to obtain Test logs, Analytics, Mark Bugs, Integrate apps from our diverse app store, fetch build details, and much more. <BrandName /> Selenium Automation Grid enables you to perform end-to-end automation tests on a secure, reliable, and scalable Selenium infrastructure. You can perform automated cross-browser testing with Selenium scripts on 3000+ browsers and operating systems environments giving you higher test coverage and at significantly less built times. <BrandName /> will help you evaluate how well your web application renders when accessed through a variety of different browsers. You can perform automated cross-browser testing of your locally hosted web pages using <BrandName /> Tunnel. You could also run a single test across multiple browser/OS configurations, simultaneously.

## LocalHost Testing Using <BrandName /> Extension

* * *

<BrandName /> extension also allows you to perform testing of your localhost project securely with the [<BrandName /> Tunnel](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) help. The below steps will help you configure the <BrandName /> Tunnel using the <BrandName /> extension in your Azure Pipelines:

### Starting The <BrandName /> Tunnel Using <BrandName /> Extension

While configuring the <BrandName /> Configuration Setup job, as shown above, check the <BrandName /> Tunnel checkbox to activate it.

Once you activate it, a <BrandName /> Tunnel Options box will appear, which require the [modifiers/arguments](/support/docs/lambda-tunnel-modifiers/) to configure the tunnel as per requirement. Pass the <BrandName /> Tunnel modifiers in JSON format in the options box.

<Warning>
Note: Make sure to use the camel case for passing the tunnel modifiers. For example, use sharedTunnel if you want to use the modifier --shared-tunnel. For our demo purpose, we will be using simple modifiers, such as --tunnel-name and --proxy-port: &lbrace;"tunnelName":"azure tunnel", "proxyPort":8050&rbrace;
</Warning>


The <BrandName /> Tunnel has been successfully configured now. You can test your locally hosted pages and privately hosted pages at the <BrandName /> Platform using <BrandName /> Tunnel.

### Stopping The <BrandName /> Tunnel Using LambaTest Extension

To stop the <BrandName /> Tunnel, you need to add the _TestMu AI Stop Tunnel_ task in your job. Once this task is executed, the <BrandName /> Tunnel will stop successfully.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/uploads/LT-ext-4-1024x528.webp' alt="azure pipeline" width="768" height="345" />

You must keep this task at the end of your all tests, to let your tests execute successfully before stopping the <BrandName /> Tunnel.

To setup your azure pipeline using <BrandName /> Azure Pipeline Extension, you can refer to the below example:

```
resources:
  repositories:
  - repository: self
    type: git
    ref: refs/heads/main
jobs:
- job: Job_1
  displayName: Agent job 1
  pool:
    vmImage: windows-2019
  steps:
  - checkout: self
    clean: true
    fetchTags: false
  - task: TestMu AI.lambda-azure-pipeline-extention.configuration-task.configuration@1
    displayName: TestMu AI configuration setup
    inputs:
      connection: 'connect endpoint'  // provide your connection name
      isTunnelActivate: true
      isAppAutomate: false // set true if you want to run your app automate test scripts

  - task: PythonScript@0
    displayName: Run a Python script
    inputs:
      scriptSource: inline
      script: >-
        print('Hello world') // provide your python script or command to run your test scripts

  - task: TestMu AI.lambda-azure-pipeline-extention.stopLambdaTunnel-task.stoptunnel@1
    displayName: TestMu AI Stop Tunnel
  - task: TestMu AI.lambda-azure-pipeline-extention.showResults-task.LambdatestResults@1
    displayName: TestMu AI Results
...
```
Also you may use the YAMl assistant to add your tasks in the pipeline YAML file
