The Fragment Identifier feature in the Accessibility Tool allows you to treat URLs with different fragment identifiers (the part after `#`) as separate entities for accessibility issue tracking and management. This advanced feature enhances the precision of accessibility audits by categorizing issues based on specific page sections or states.

## Enabling Fragment Identifier

---

To enable the Fragment Identifier feature:

1. Navigate to **Accessibility DevTools** → **Settings**
2. Go to **Other Settings** section
3. Locate the **Fragment Identifier** option
4. Toggle the setting to **enabled**

<Warning>
  **Note:** This feature is **disabled by default**. When disabled, URLs with different fragment identifiers are treated as the same URL for issue tracking.

## How Fragment Identifier Works

---

Fragment identifiers are the portion of a URL that comes after the `#` symbol. They typically reference specific sections, anchors, or states within a webpage.

### Default Behavior (Feature Disabled)

```bash
URL: https://example.com/page#section1
URL: https://example.com/page#section2
URL: https://example.com/page#section3

Result: All issues grouped under "https://example.com/page"
```

### Enhanced Behavior (Feature Enabled)

```bash
URL: https://example.com/page#section1
URL: https://example.com/page#section2
URL: https://example.com/page#section3

Result: Issues categorized separately:
- "https://example.com/page#section1"
- "https://example.com/page#section2"
- "https://example.com/page#section3"
```

## Benefits

---

1. **Granular Issue Tracking**: Track accessibility issues with precision for specific page sections
2. **Enhanced SPA Support**: Better support for modern single-page applications using hash-based routing
3. **Improved Workflow**: Assign and manage issues for specific page areas independently
4. **Detailed Reporting**: Generate more comprehensive reports with section-specific insights
