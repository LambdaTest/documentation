SmartUI CLI allows you to group screenshots in a build name and append new screenshots to an existing build. This feature enables you to assign build names, add screenshots to existing builds and manage your visual tests efficiently.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Command Line Interface
- Login to [LambdaTest SmartUI](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/) with your credentials.
- Ensure you are using `@lambdatest/smartui-cli` version 4.1.43 or higher
- A properly configured SmartUI CLI project

<Note>
NOTE

If you face any problems executing tests with SmartUI-CLI `versions >= v4.x.x`, upgrade your Node.js version to `v20.3` or above.
</Note>

## Step 1: Install SmartUI CLI

If you haven't already installed SmartUI CLI, install it using npm:

**Global Installation (Recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g @lambdatest/smartui-cli
```

**Local Installation:**
```bash
npm install @lambdatest/smartui-cli
```

## Step 2: Configure your Project Token

Setup your project token shown in the **SmartUI** app after creating your project.

```bash
export PROJECT_TOKEN="123456#1234abcd-****-****-****-************"
```

</Tab>
<Tab title='Windows - CMD'>

```bash
set PROJECT_TOKEN="123456#1234abcd-****-****-****-************"
```

</Tab>
<Tab title='PowerShell'>

```powershell
$env:PROJECT_TOKEN="123456#1234abcd-****-****-****-************"
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Execute Tests with custom Build Names

You can add a custom build name by adding the `--buildName` flag to your test execution command. Here are different ways to use this feature:

#### Custom Build Name (Expected Usage)
Specify a custom build name to group your screenshots in the following way:

```bash
npx smartui --config .smartui.json exec --buildName "Sample Build Name" -- <execution-command>
```

<Warning>
**Example:**
 For a `Node.js` test script :
```bash
>npx smartui --config .smartui.json exec --buildName "Sample Build Name" -- node test.js
```
</Warning>

### Default Usage
If no buildname is specified, a random build name is added to the builds:

```bash
npx smartui --config .smartui.json exec -- <execution-command>
```

## Step 4: Advanced Use Case

If you are running multiple test cases in a single job (e.g., using HyperExecute) and want to club all screenshots under a single build while maintaining consistent Git baseline management, you can do the following:

This can be done as follows:

```bash
npx smartui --config .smartui.json exec --buildName $env:JOB_ID -- node test.js
```

## Key Benefits
- **Efficient Grouping:** Screenshots are grouped by build names, improving organization and traceability.
- **Seamless Git Integration:** Integrates smoothly with Git to maintain baseline integrity across branches.
- **Flexible Updates:** Allows appending screenshots to existing builds, enhancing adaptability.
- **Optimized Workflows:** Supports streamlined operations for both parallel and single-job executions.

## Conclusion
This approach provides a structured and efficient way to manage visual tests:
- **New Build for Each HyperExecute Job:** A dedicated build is created for every HyperExecute job, ensuring clear separation and traceability.
- **Consolidated Screenshot Grouping:** Screenshots from all tests within the same job are appended to a single build for seamless organization.
- **Uninterrupted Git Workflow:** Git branching strategies remain unaffected, enabling robust baseline management across branches.
