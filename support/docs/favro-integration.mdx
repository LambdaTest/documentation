# Favro Integration

* * *

Favro is a project management and collaboration tool set up by serial deep tech entrepreneurs. It works under an agile methodology that helps in planning, execution, collaboration, and creation to enhance the workflow of your organization. You can create your dashboard where you can track your various projects, interact, respond to ideas, handle projects with your teammates using multiple kanbans, timelines, and sheets. 

The <BrandName /> Favro Integration allows you to create a task directly to your specified Favro dashboard from <BrandName /> platform. Share your UI observations and input with your teammates anytime, by [capturing a screenshot](https://www.lambdatest.com/full-page-screen-capture), even in the middle of your test session. You can annotate the screenshot & highlight your issue or input. The fields populated by you when marking as bug through <BrandName /> are displayed as information on Favro for that testing instance.

## How To Integrate Favro With Your <BrandName /> Account?

* * *

**Step 1:** Login to your <BrandName /> account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

>* **What is my Favro E-mail? **   
>In this field you need to specify the **email id** through which you sign into your **Favro** account. 
>* ** What is an API Token?**   
>When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.    
>If you are logging into **Favro** for the first time, then you can generate a token for yourself by just entering a name of your choice.

**Step 5:** Login your favro account and navigate to **'My Profile'** on the left.
