## What is `npm_via_tunnel`?

`npm_via_tunnel` is a flag that you can use to enable downloading npm dependencies through a tunnel. This can be useful if you need to install npm packages from a private registry or if you are working in a restricted environment where you cannot access the public npm registry directly.

## Why use `npm_via_tunnel`?

There are a few reasons why you might want to use `npm_via_tunnel`:

- **Security:** If you are installing npm packages from a private registry, you may want to use a tunnel to protect your traffic from being intercepted.

- **Reliability:** If you are working in a restricted environment, a tunnel can help to ensure that npm can still access the registry and download the packages you need.

- **Flexibility:** You can use a tunnel to access npm packages from any source, including public registries, private registries, and even local repositories.

## How to use npm_via_tunnel

To use `npm_via_tunnel`, simply add the following line to your run settings:

```bash
"npm_via_tunnel": true
```

Once you have enabled this flag, npm will automatically route all of its traffic through the tunnel.

## For first-time users:

If you are using `npm_via_tunnel` for the first time, here are a few things you should keep in mind:

- You will need to have a tunnel already configured and running. There are a number of different ways to create a tunnel, so you will need to choose the method that is best for your environment.

- Once you have followed these steps, npm will automatically route all of its traffic through the tunnel and you will be able to install npm packages from the specified registry.

<Note>
To download private dependencies follow this [documentation](/support/docs/private-dependencies-cypress/).

## Troubleshooting

If you are having problems with npm_via_tunnel, you can try the following troubleshooting tips:

- Make sure that the tunnel is properly configured and running.

- Verify that the npm registry is accessible from within the tunnel.

- Try disabling any proxy servers or firewalls that may be interfering with the tunnel connection.

## Conclusion

`npm_via_tunnel` is a powerful tool that can help you to install npm packages from a variety of sources, including private registries and restricted environments. By using this flag, you can improve the security, reliability, and flexibility of your npm installations.
