Userback is a platform that makes it easy for website and app teams to gather user feedback. It helps streamline the feedback process, allowing teams to collect and manage visual feedback from users directly on their websites or applications. This feedback can be in the form of screenshots, annotations, and comments, making it easier for teams to understand user suggestions or issues.
