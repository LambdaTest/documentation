<Warning>
You can now avoid the hassle of capturing a screenshot, annotating the same before you finally share it with a teammate by logging onto a respective tool for creating a task. LambdaTest does it all for you. **Mark as Bug** is a feature that would help you highlight any UI observation from your test sessions on LambdaTest. And you can share the same with your colleagues on their favorite project management/ bug tracking tools such as Jira and Trello, Hive, Paymo, etc. You can choose the assignee who handles your reported task, or Bug. You can even mention the description to help them understand your point better. You can do all that while testing on LambdaTest, without having to hop on to any other platform or tool.
</Warning>

<Note>

**Note:** Mark as Bug feature is not restricted to any particular feature at LambdaTest. In other words, every type of testing that you perform on LambdaTest will have a mark as bug embedded in it. Below are various types of testing that we offer at LambdaTest.
</Note>

- **Real Time Testing:** To help you test your web-app with live interaction by running it on VMs hosted by LambdaTest cloud server.

- **Screenshot Testing:** Automated bulk [screenshot testing](/support/docs/automated-screenshot-testing/) on 25(browsers + OS) combinations in a single test session.

- **Responsive Testing:** Perform cross browser testing across various mobile & desktop devices to ensure your website renders well across different view-ports. Run responsive testing on 46 devices in a single test session.

- **Automation Testing:** Perform automated cross browser testing with our on-cloud Selenium Grid. You can execute parallel testing to trim down your test cycles drastically. Our [Selenium Grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/why-selenium-grid-is-ideal-for-automated-browser-testing/) is compatible with every test automation framework that supports Selenium.

- **Smart UI Testing:** Automated visual regression testing that performs a pixel-to-pixel comparison between multiple images & highlights any UI deviations such as padding, icon, text, etc., concerning the baseline images.

<Warning>
**Did You Know?**
LambdaTest offers more than 3000+ real browsers and browser versions on every type of testing so you could maximize test coverage of your cross browser testing.

**Step 4:** As you double-click on any screenshot, an image editor will pop up with various buttons to help you highlight and annotate your UI observation before sharing the screenshot with your colleagues.

- You can highlight the bug through different shapes like square, rectangular, circular, or you can even underline. Environment details of the test will be presented at the bottom-left of the image editor.
