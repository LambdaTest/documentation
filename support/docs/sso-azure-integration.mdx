<BrandName /> allows you to integrate an external user directory with your <BrandName /> Organization through an IDP so your team could leverage the Single Sign-on setup. This document will help you integrate your <BrandName /> organization with your Azure AD directory to configure SSO(Single sign-on). After you integrate your Azure AD instance with your <BrandName /> for Single Sign-on, you can benefit from the following features:

*   Monitor who access to <BrandName />
*   Manage your account in Azure Active Directory.
*   Sign-in directly to the <BrandName /> with Azure AD credentials.

To know more, refer [How SSO is implemented in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).
