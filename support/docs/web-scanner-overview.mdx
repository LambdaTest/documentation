## What is <BrandName /> Web Scanner?

<BrandName /> Web Scanner is an AI-powered, browser-based scanning platform designed to help teams identify and resolve visual and accessibility issues across web applications. It enables both automated Visual UI Regression Testing and WCAG-compliant Accessibility Testing, allowing organizations to proactively catch visual bugs and accessibility violations across thousands of URLs at scale.

This tool empowers QA teams, developers, and compliance managers to perform scheduled scans on public or locally-hosted sites, compare builds visually with pixel-perfect precision, and generate audit-ready accessibility reports.

## Why Web Scanner?

Manual testing of large web applications for layout shifts, broken UI, or WCAG non-compliance is slow and error-prone. <BrandName /> Web Scanner solves this by enabling:

* Automated visual comparisons across multiple browsers and resolutions powered by SmartUI
* Accessibility audits powered by dynamic WCAG checks
* Smart scheduling of one-time or recurring scans
* Support for authenticated and local testing pages
* Seamless redirection to SmartUI and Accessibility Dashboards

## Supported Scan Types

### 1. Visual UI Scan

Visual scans detect pixel-based layout changes, design mismatches, missing elements, or unintended visual regressions by comparing screenshots taken at scheduled intervals.
