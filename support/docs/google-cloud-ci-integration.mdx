Google Cloud Platform is one of the market’s leading public cloud providers and offers a variety of management services. Google Cloud Build and Google Cloud Run are two Google Cloud services that use pipelines to automate builds and deployments.

Integrate your Selenium test suites with Google Cloud CI and perform automated cross-browser testing on [online Selenium Grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) over 3000+ real browser environments. With this integration, you can also perform local testing of locally or privately hosted projects and Parallel testing to cut short test execution cycles and achieve faster go-to-market delivery.

## Prerequisites
***

Before integrating Google Cloud CI with Lambdatest, make sure you have the following things:

1. A GitHub or a BitBucket repository. All the code samples in this documentation can be found at [Lambdatest Google Cloud CI](https://github.com/LambdaTest/Java-TestNG-Selenium) repository on GitHub .

2. To integrate test suites with Google Cloud CI, you would need to set your Lambdatest username and access key in environment variables. You can get them from [Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/) by clicking on the Key button from the top-right.

*   **For Windows:**
    ```
    set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
    set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
    ```

*   **For Mac/Linux:**
    ```
     export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
     export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
    ```

## Integrating A GitHub Repository With Google Cloud CI
***

To integrate Google Cloud CI with Lambdatest, you will need to fork the above Lambdatest Google Cloud CI repository.

1.  Go to the Google Cloud CI console and select **'Cloud Build'**.

You can also view the detailed insights of your test execution on [Lambdatest Automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/timeline/).

## Running Parallel Test Via Google Cloud CI

* * *

To run parallel tests on Lambdatest cloud, you will need to make minor tweaks in `cloudbuild.yml` file.

```
steps:
- name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
  args: ['run' , '-d', '--name=lt', '--network=cloudbuild', 'lambdatest/tunnel', '--user', '${_LT_USERNAME}', '--key', '${_LT_ACCESS_KEY}', '--tunnelName', 'GCloud', '--infoAPIPort', '15000','--load-balanced']
- name: curlimages/curl
  args: ['-s', '--retry-connrefused', '--connect-timeout', '5', '--max-time', '5', '--retry', '30', '--retry-delay', '2', '--retry-max-time', '60', 'http://lt:15000/api/v1.0/info']
- name: 'ubuntu'
  args: ['sleep', '20']
- name: 'bash'
  args: ['ls']
- name: 'maven'
  entrypoint: 'mvn'
  args: ['test', '-P', 'parallel']
  env:
  - 'LT_USERNAME=${_LT_USERNAME}'
  - 'LT_ACCESS_KEY=${_LT_ACCESS_KEY}'
```

In the above YAML code, you need to add the following command to **args**.

`mvn test -P parallel`

Below is the screenshot of the above-executed parallel tests.

## Running Local Test Via Google Cloud CI

* * *

To run local tests on Lambdatest cloud, you will need to make minor tweaks in `cloudbuild.yml` file.

```
steps:
- name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
  args: ['run' , '-d', '--name=lt', '--network=cloudbuild', 'lambdatest/tunnel', '--user', '${_LT_USERNAME}', '--key', '${_LT_ACCESS_KEY}', '--tunnelName', 'GCloud', '--infoAPIPort', '15000','--load-balanced']
- name: curlimages/curl
  args: ['-s', '--retry-connrefused', '--connect-timeout', '5', '--max-time', '5', '--retry', '30', '--retry-delay', '2', '--retry-max-time', '60', 'http://lt:15000/api/v1.0/info']
- name: 'ubuntu'
  args: ['sleep', '20']
- name: 'bash'
  args: ['ls']
- name: 'maven'
  entrypoint: 'mvn'
  args: ['test', '-P', 'local']
  env:
  - 'LT_USERNAME=${_LT_USERNAME}'
  - 'LT_ACCESS_KEY=${_LT_ACCESS_KEY}'
```

Add the below command to **args**.

`mvn test -P local`

Below is the screenshot of the above-executed local tests.
