In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your Java automation testing scripts on  [<BrandName /> Selenium cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using Ruby framework TestUnit.

## Objective
***
By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **TestUnit** framework with **Selenium**.
2. Run a sample Selenium with **TestUnit Ruby** on <BrandName /> Automation.
3. Setting up environment for testing your locally hosted web pages or website.

>**Note:** All the code samples in this documentation can be found in the [<BrandName />'s Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/<BrandName />/Ruby-UnitTest-Selenium). You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests.

## Prerequisites For Running TestUnit With Selenium
***
Before you can start performing Ruby automation testing with Selenium, you would need to:

* Install Ruby and gem on your local system. Follow these instructions to install on different operating systems.
  * For **Windows**, you can download from the [official website](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).
  * For **Linux** or **Ubuntu**, you can run a simple apt command like below:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install ruby-full
  ```
  * For **macOS**, you can run a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) command like this:
  ```bash
  brew install ruby
  ```
* To run tests in parallel you will require the [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests) gem.
* <BrandName /> binary file for running tests on your locally hosted web pages.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and Tutorial Repo

**Step 1:**  Clone the [<BrandName />’s Ruby-UnitTest-Selenium repository](https://github.com/<BrandName />/Ruby-UnitTest-Selenium) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TestMu AI-sample-test-frameworks/Ruby-UnitTest-Selenium.git
cd Ruby-UnitTest-Selenium
```
**Step 2:** After navigating to the cloned directory, install project dependencies using the below commands:
```bash
bundle install
```

### Setting up Your Authentication
Make sure you have your <BrandName /> credentials with you to run test automation scripts with TestUnit on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [<BrandName /> Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/) or through <BrandName /> Profile.

**Step 3:** Set <BrandName /> Username and Access Key in environment variables.
 * For Linux/macOS:
 `export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`
 * For Windows:
 `set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`

## Run Your First Test

### Sample Test with TestUnit Ruby

The example mentioned below would help you to execute your automation test using TestUnit Ruby.
```ruby
# TestMu AI.rb

require 'rubygems'
require 'selenium-webdriver'
require 'test/unit'
require_relative  "readConf"

class UnitTestLTSample < Test::Unit::TestCase

    def setup
		config = ReadConfig.new()	
		lt_user = ENV['LT_USERNAME']
		lt_key = ENV['LT_ACCESS_KEY']
		lt_os = ENV['LT_OPERATING_SYSTEM']
		lt_browser = ENV['LT_BROWSER']
		lt_browser_version = ENV['LT_BROWSER_VERSION']
		if(lt_user == "" || lt_user == nil)
			lt_user = config.getDetails('LT_USERNAME')
		end
		if(lt_key == "" || lt_key == nil)
			lt_key = config.getDetails('LT_ACCESS_KEY')
		end
		if(lt_browser == "" || lt_browser == nil)
			lt_browser = config.getDetails('LT_BROWSER')
		end
		if(lt_os == "" || lt_os ==nil)
			lt_os = config.getDetails('LT_OPERATING_SYSTEM')
		end
		if(lt_browser_version == "" || lt_browser_version == nil)
			lt_browser_version = config.getDetails('LT_BROWSER_VERSION')
		end	
		caps = {						
			:browserName => lt_browser,			
			:version => lt_browser_version,			
			:platform =>  lt_os,
			:name =>  "UnitTest Sample Test",
			:build =>  "UnitTest Selenium Build"
		} 	
		puts (caps)
		@driver = Selenium::WebDriver.for(:remote,
			:url => "http://"+lt_user+":"+lt_key+"@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub",
			:desired_capabilities => caps)
		
		@driver.manage.window.maximize
		
        @driver.get("https://testmu ai.github.io/sample-todo-app/" )
        sleep(10)
	end

    def test_Login
        item_name = "Yey, Lets add it to list"

        #Click on First Checkbox
        fCheckbox = @driver.find_element(:name, 'li1')
        fCheckbox.click

        #Click on Second Checkbox
        sCheckbox = @driver.find_element(:name, 'li2')
        sCheckbox.click
    
        #Enter Item Name 
        itemNameInput = @driver.find_element(:id, 'sampletodotext')
        itemNameInput.send_keys item_name
        
        #Click on Add Button
        addButton = @driver.find_element(:id, 'addbutton')
        addButton.submit

        # Verify Added Item
        getItemName = @driver.find_element(:xpath, '/html/body/div/div/div/ul/li[6]/span').text
		assert_equal(getItemName, item_name )
    end
    
    def teardown
		@driver.quit
	end
	
end
```
### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities
**Step 4:** In the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with <BrandName /> Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities in the above code are defined as:
```ruby
caps = {						
			:browserName => lt_browser,			
			:version => lt_browser_version,			
			:platform =>  lt_os,
			:name =>  "UnitTest Sample Test",
			:build =>  "UnitTest Selenium Build"
		} 	
```
<Warning>
You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **<a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/">Capabilities Generator Tool</a>**.
</Warning>


### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** Navigate to the directory where you cloned the sample of TestUnit Ruby and run the following command.
```bash
ruby TestMu AI.rb
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on <BrandName /> automation dashboard. [<BrandName /> Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects
***
You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [<BrandName /> Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using <BrandName /> Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using <BrandName /> Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. <BrandName /> Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [<BrandName /> Tunnel documentation](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Here’s how you can establish <BrandName /> Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
>* [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is testmu ai@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user testmu ai@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **<BrandName /> Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```ruby
caps = {             
            ...          
            :tunnel => true,         
            ...
        }  
```
