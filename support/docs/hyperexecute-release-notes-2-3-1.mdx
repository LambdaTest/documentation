## Mask Your Sensitive Data

Test recordings often capture all user interactions, including potentially sensitive information like credentials, geo-location, storage-state etc. This can be a security risk if the recordings are accidentally exposed. Hence to overcome this limitation, HyperExecute releases a new feature **Lambda Masking**.

## Benefits of Masking

- **Enhanced Security:** Masking allows you to automatically hide sensitive data in your recorded test commands, mitigating the risk of exposure.

- **Improved Compliance:** This feature can help you adhere to stricter data security regulations and best practices.
