## Artifact Extraction on Job Abortion
- Artifacts will now be extracted even if a job is aborted in the middle of a test.
- This ensures that partial test results and logs are still available for review, improving debugging and post-test analysis.


## `afterEachScenario` Flag for Test Cleanup
- Introduced the `afterEachScenario` flag to automate post-test scenario tasks. This flag is useful for cleanup activities such as clearing cookies, resetting databases, or capturing logs.
- Commands or scripts listed under this flag will execute sequentially after each test scenario, ensuring test isolation and consistency.

```yaml
afterEachScenario:
  - echo "Running a script"
  - pwsh run.test
```
