Using <BrandName /> integration with TargetProcess, you’ll be able to log bugs over your project in TargetProcess from <BrandName /> in just a single click. You can [capture a screenshot](https://www.lambdatest.com/full-page-screen-capture) of the bug, highlight the anomaly, annotate extra information, choose an assignee, provide a suitable title, and description to help relay further actions. You can do all that directly from <BrandName />.

**What is Dashboard URL?**<br />
TargetProcess uses boards to visualise data. The dashboard URL would be the link of your customised board that you would create to track any project, tasks, or bugs etc. We will be using the highlighted User Story for demonstration.

**What are Access Tokens?**

Access tokens are strings with the authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client-server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.

## Where can I create my TargetProcess Access Token?

You can generate your TargetProcess access token by clicking on the user avatar displayed on the top right and going to **Admin User**.
