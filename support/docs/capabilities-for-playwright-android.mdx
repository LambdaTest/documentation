## Using REGEX for device name
Regular Expression or REGEX is widely used to make searching/find characters in a string.

When you run a test on <BrandName /> using a specific device, there may be scenarios, in which the particular device that you selected isn’t available. In these scenarios, REGEX will help you widen the search request for devices to run the test on.

To quote an example, consider you want to run the test on an Pixel. It doesn’t matter which one, but it’s got to be an Pixel. In these cases, we can use REGEX to specify exactly that. You’ll now be allotted any Pixel device that’s available which widens the search of devices considerably.

Refer [REGEX for App/Browser Automation](/support/docs/regular-expression-appium/) to read more on this.
