Azure DevOps, previously known as **VSTS: Visual Studio Team Services** – A software developed by Microsoft Corporations to provide an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) for facilitating management & development regarding a software project. Azure DevOps provides a set of specific, cloud-based collaboration tools for developers, testers & software architects. So you can plan smarter and ship even faster with the help of effective collaboration. With their **Azure Pipelines** you can deploy your development to any Git provider cloud.

The Lambdatest Azure DevOps Integration allows you to create a work item directly in your project from Lambdatest platform. Push a bug, epic, task, story to your respective project anytime, even in the middle of your test session. The fields populated by you when marking as a bug through Lambdatest are displayed as information on the work item in Azure DevOps project for that testing instance.

<Note>
  INFO <br />
  We recently added support for custom fields to our integration. From now on, all
  required custom fields in your Azure Devops account will be visible in your bug
  marking form on Lambdatest.
</Note>

**Azure DevOps Integration with Lambdatest, like all of our other integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.**

- **What are access tokens?**

Access tokens are strings with authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.

**Step 6:** After you click on **'+ New Token'**, mention a **name** for the access token. Define the **scopes** for authorizing access. By doing so, you will be providing the level of access you want to provide to any 3rd party API. For Lambdatest integration with Azure DevOps, select the radio button for **'Full access'** & click on **'Create'**.

- A token is generated, copy the token to your clipboard and make sure to store it safely with you.

![azure-devops-integration](/assets/images/azure-devops-integration/Screenshot-280.webp)

Access tokens are just as important as your passwords and shall not be misplaced into wrong hands. If by any chance you lose it in future or it gets shared to someone whom you don't trust, then you can always revoke the token and create a new one.

For revoking a token, click on any personal access token and hit the **'Revoke'**.
