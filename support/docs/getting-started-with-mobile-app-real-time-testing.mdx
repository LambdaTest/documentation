Real-Time Mobile App Testing allows you to test mobile applications directly on real devices in real time. It ensures that your app functions as intended, performs optimally, and provides a seamless user experience across various mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. With <BrandName />, developers, testers, and QA professionals can interact with their mobile applications as end users would, on actual devices, without needing to manage an in-house device lab.

## Launch the Virtual Machine

- Navigate to the Real Time Testing section.
- Select **Virtual Mobile** from the **App Testing** section.
- To test your application, enter its URL or upload your application from your local machine and select your **Device** - Andoroid, iOS, or [ChromeOS](/support/docs/chrome-os-testing/), and its version.
- Afterwards click on the **Start** button to initiate the testing process.

## Dashboard Walkthrough
The Real-Time Testing dashboard provides an intuitive interface for managing your testing sessions:

- **Operating System Tabs :** Located at the top, this section allows you to toggle between different operating systems (Android, and iOS).

- **Device Selection Panel :** Allows you to filter devices by operating system (Android or iOS), manufacturer, and model. Lists popular devices, including the latest models, to test on.

- **Upload Apps :** In the dashboard, there is a section for uploading your mobile application. You can either:
  - **Provide a URL :** Use this if the app is hosted online or accessible via a direct link.
  - **Upload from Local System :** Use this option to upload the application file (APK/IPA) from your computer.

- **Tunnel :** For testing on environments that are not publicly accessible, configure the Tunnel settings to enable testing on staging or local sites.

- **Switch to Real Devices :** If you need to perform tests on physical devices, click on the Switch to Real Devices link to access <BrandName />'s real device cloud.

- **Start Button :** Located on the right side of the URL field, this button initializes the testing session once you have chosen your device and browser configuration.
