### Step 2: Define Test Cases in a Jira Ticket
- **Create or Open a Jira Ticket :** Start by creating a Jira ticket or accessing an existing ticket where you want to outline test cases.
- **Write Test Case Details :** In the comments section, add detailed information about the test cases you want to execute. Clearly describe each test case's steps, conditions, expected outcomes, and any other relevant information to help Kane AI generate accurate tests.

### Step 3: Generate Test Cases Using Kane AI
To trigger Kane AI, add the comment to your Jira ticket calling <BrandName /> application, for example:

```bash
@TestMu AI create test case based on the details of this Jira
```

<Note>

### Step 4: Review and Schedule the Test Case on <BrandName />

- **Review Test Case Details :** Check the generated test case for accuracy. You can review test steps, expected outcomes, and conditions to ensure they align with your requirements.
- **Schedule the Task for KaneAI :** Once verified, schedule the task for KaneAI to generate and automate the test case on its own.

### Step 5: Check the test execution
Click on the Live Preview button to enter the playground and check the live execution of your test based on your defined objective.
