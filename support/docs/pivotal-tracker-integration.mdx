**Step 6:** Scroll down on your Profile page and you will find a section where you have your API token generated. This API token will help you authenticate your access as you integrate your Pivotal tracker with any third-party applications. Please handle the API token with care. Treat them as your passwords as somebody else can authenticate a third-party application on your behalf. In case you feel your API token has been revealed to someone you don't trust then you can create a new API token in the Pivotal tracker. You can also remove an older API token if you like.
