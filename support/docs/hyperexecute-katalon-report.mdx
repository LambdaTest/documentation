HyperExecute provides seamless integration with Katalon Studio, enabling you to generate and view detailed execution reports directly from your test runs. These reports include details such as:

- Test case execution status (Pass/Fail/Skipped)
- Execution time and duration
- Environment and browser details
- Stack traces for failed tests

<Note>
Ensure your project is configured with the [Katalon framework](/support/docs/katalon-integration-with-hyperexecute/) and all test scripts are in place.
