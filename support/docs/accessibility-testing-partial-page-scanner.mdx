While the [Full Page Scanner](/support/docs/accessibility-testing-full-page-scanner/) analyzes an entire webpage, the Partial Page Scanner provides a more focused approach to accessibility evaluation.

It analyzes specific regions or elements within a webpage instead of the entire page. It is Ideal for:

- Testing specific components like forms, interactive elements, or embedded content.
- Investigating reported accessibility issues on particular sections of a webpage.
- Evaluating accessibility changes made to a specific area.

## Functionalities of Partial Page Scanner

- **Manual Selection :** Choose the specific area you want to scan by highlighting it on the webpage.
- **Targeted Analysis :** Focuses on the selected area and identifies potential accessibility issues within that region.
- **WCAG Compliance Checks :** Similar to the Full Page Scanner, it checks for violations against relevant WCAG guidelines within the chosen area.
- **Detailed Reporting :** Provides a report highlighting identified issues, descriptions, and WCAG references, specific to the scanned region.
