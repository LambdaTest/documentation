Appium is an open-source framework that allows you to automate tests for mobile applications. It works across different platforms like Android and iOS, enabling you to write tests once and run them on various devices.

Appium leverages the WebDriver protocol, similar to how Selenium automates web applications. This makes it compatible with [popular programming languages](/support/docs/appium-languages-and-frameworks/) for writing test scripts.

Here is a list of languages and frameworks that are supported by the <BrandName /> to run Appium automation tests on [<BrandName /> Real Device Cloud Platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/real-device-cloud).

<Note>
We support all languages and frameworks that are compatible with Selenium, so in case your favorite isn't in the table. Don't worry, you can still run the test. Contact us for any help.
