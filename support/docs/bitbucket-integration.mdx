Bitbucket – A web-based repository hosting service owned by Atlassian for facilitating version control in development projects. It supports the project with a revision control system based on either Git or Mercurial. It is free to use, though they also offer a commercial plan. With Bitbucket, you can perform **access control** to your source-code, **workflow control** to impose a project workflow. Easy code revaluation through pull requests offering in-line annotation & Integration with Jira for end-to-end development tracing.

The <BrandName /> Bitbucket Integration allows you to create an issue directly in your repository from <BrandName /> platform. Push an issue to your respective repository anytime, even in the middle of your test session. The fields populated by you when marking as a bug through <BrandName /> are displayed as information on the issue in the repository for a testing instance.

**Bitbucket Integration with <BrandName />, like all of our other integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.**

## How To Integrate Bitbucket With Your <BrandName /> Account?
***
**Step 1:** Login to your <BrandName /> account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select **‘Integrations’** from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your <BrandName /> account.

**Step 3:** Click on **‘Add’** under the block that says ‘Bitbucket’.

**Note:** Make sure you have an account signed up with Bitbucket before you begin the integration. If you don’t have then you will be redirected to a screen where you can create one. If you already have an account setup for any of the Atlassian tools then you may use the same credentials as that one.

**Step 4.** Once you click on the sign up button, you will be asked to provide a unique username. After providing the username, you need to click **‘Continue’.**

![form](/assets/images/project-management-tools-bitbucket-integration/bitbucket-form.webp)

**Step 5.** As you press "ADD" button, you will be directed to an authentication page. Here you will need to grant <BrandName /> the access to your user-owned resources on Bitbucket. Hit on the blue button that says **"Grant access".**

**Why we ask for your login credentials?**

Bitbucket APIs uses OAuth 2.0’s [authorization code grant flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) for generating access tokens on user’s behalf.

**What is an Access token?**

Access tokens are strings with authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client-server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.

That is it, you will be notified with a prompt message on top mentioning that Bitbucket is successfully installed. If you look at your Integrations again and you will be able to notice a **green tick** indicating the same. You can now experience bug logging in a fly from any of your running test session in <BrandName /> to your respective repository directly by a single click.
