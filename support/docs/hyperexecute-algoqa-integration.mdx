algoQA is an AI Native software testing platform that automates end-to-end tests across web, mobile, desktop, and API applications. It generates optimal test cases, datasets, and executable scripts, reducing manual effort and improving test coverage.

This document will guide you how to integrate your algoQA project with HyperExecute

## Prerequisites

To run the Tests on HyperExecute from your Local System, you are required:

- Your <BrandName /> [Username and Access key](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-get-my-username-and-access-key/)
- [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) in order to initiate a test execution Job .
- Setup the [Environment Variable](/support/docs/hyperexecute-environment-variable-setup/)
- [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-version0.2/) file which contains all the necessary instructions.

## Step 1: Setup Your Test Suite

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Check>
**SAMPLE REPO**

Download or Clone the code sample for the algoQA from the <BrandName /> GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

<GitHubButton url="https://github.com/LambdaTest/algoQA-HyperExecute-sample" />
</Check>

## Step 2: Setup the CLI in your Test Suite

After cloning / downloading the sample repo, you need to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

### Download the HyperExecute CLI

The CLI is used for triggering the tests on HyperExecute. It is recommend to download the CLI binary on the host system and keep it in the root directory of the suite to perform the tests on HyperExecute.

You can download the CLI for your desired platform from the below mentioned links:

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| MacOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |

### Setup Environment Variable

Now, you need to export your environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [<BrandName /> Profile page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).

Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Linux / MacOS
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```

```powershell Windows
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Configure YAML in your Test Suite

```yaml
---
version: 0.1
globalTimeout: 150
testSuiteTimeout: 150
testSuiteStep: 150

runson: win

autosplit: true

retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 1

concurrency: 2

cacheKey: '{{ checksum "pom.xml" }}'
cacheDirectories:
  - .m2

pre:
  - mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=./.m2 dependency:resolve

report: true
partialReports:
    type: json
    location: target/
    frameworkName: extent-native
  
uploadArtifacts:
  - name: FinalReport 
    path:
    - ExtentReports/**

testDiscovery:
  type: automatic
  mode: static
  args:
    featureFilePaths: src/test/java/features/
    frameWork: java

testRunnerCommand: mvn test `-Dplatname=win `-Dmaven.repo.local=./.m2 `-Dcucumber.features="$test"

jobLabel: ['HYP', 'algoQA']
```

## Step 4: Amend in your ApplicationSettings.xml file

In your `ApplicationSettings.xml` file, update the following capabilities:

- **BrowserType :** It should be Lambda.
- **LambdaTestBuild :** Provide your build name.
- **LambdaTestURL :** Provide your HUB URL. For e.g. `https://username:access-key@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub`

## Step 5: Execute your Test Suite

<Note>
**NOTE**

In case of MacOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General tab**.
</Note>

Run the below command in your terminal at the root folder of the project:

```bash
./hyperexecute --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

OR use this command if you have not exported your username and access key in the step 2.

```bash
./hyperexecute --user YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME --key YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

## Step 6: Monitor the Test Execution

Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status.
