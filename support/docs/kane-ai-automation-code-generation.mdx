## Web Frameworks

### Selenium
Selenium is your go-to tool for cross-browser testing, enabling automated testing across different web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It's perfect for end-to-end testing of web applications. With Kane AI, you can generate Selenium code in:

- **Python:** PyTest is used to generate Selenium Python code.

<Info>
**Support for Java language in Selenium has been restricted for major improvements and will be made available soon.**

</Info>

<Tip>
**By default all KaneAI authored tests automation scripts for Web are generated in Selenium Python.**

</Tip>

### Playwright
Playwright is a fast and reliable end-to-end testing for complex modern web applications it uses a single API to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. You can generate Playwright code in:

- **JavaScript**
- **Python** 

<Info>
**Support for Playwright framework has been restricted for major improvements and will be made available soon.**

</Info>

### Cypress
Cypress is a modern web front-end testing tool built with JavaScript Mocha. It operates directly on the browsers without the need for Selenium. Its unique DOM manipulation technique makes it a very developer and QA friendly tool. You can generate Cypress code in:

- **JavaScript**

<Info>
**Support for Cypress framework has been restricted for major improvements and will be made available soon. Additionally, Cypress won't be available for test cases where **Switching Tabs** or **File Upload** is present as it's not inherently supported by the framework.**

</Info>

### WebdriverIO
WebdriverIO is a popular automation testing framework for web and mobile applications. It is built on top of the WebDriver protocol and provides a simple and flexible API for writing tests. You can generate WebdriverIO code in:

- **JavaScript**

<Info>
**Support for WebdriverIO framework has been restricted for major improvements and will be made available soon.**

</Info>

## App Frameworks

### Appium
Appium is an open-source automation tool for running scripts and testing native applications and mobile web apps on different platforms like iOS and Android. You can generate Appium code in:

- **Python:**  PyTest is used to generate Appium Python script. 
- **Java:** TestNG is used to generate Appium Java scripts.
- **JavaScript** : The code generation for the Appium framework in JavaScript is being rolled out gradually and is not yet generally available.

<Tip>
**By default all KaneAI authored tests automation scripts for App are generated in Appium Python.**

</Tip>

<Note>
**For now test runs only work for code generation in Selenium - Python & Appium Python. The support for others will be rolled out shortly.**
