# TeamCity Integration With HyperExecute

TeamCity is a build management and continuous integration server developed by JetBrains. It is used to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software. It supports a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including Java, .NET, Ruby, and Python.

This document will show you how to integrate TeamCity with HyperExecute to greatly shorten your test cycles.

## How to Integrate TeamCity with HyperExecute
***

To integrate TeamCity with HyperExecute, follow the below mentioned steps:

### Pre-requisite:

- Install [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) (recommend) in your device.
- Download the [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/) in your device.

### Step 1: Start the TeamCity GUI

- Go to the **teamcity/bin** folder and run the command **./runAll.sh start** to start the TeamCity Server in your system.
- Now type ``http://localhost:8111/`` in your browser to open the TeamCity GUI.
- Click on Create Project button.

### Step 2: Create the Project

- For the demo purposes, we will be using the GitHub repository to create the project. Thus, select **From a repository URL** section.
- Enter the **Repository URL** from which you want to set up the project.
- Enter the **Username** and **Password** of your GitHub. (It is required in case the access to the repo needed authentication).
-  Click on **Proceed** button.

### Step 3: Connect your Version Control System.

- Connect your GitHub / GitLab wherever you have stored your tests.
- Enter your **Project name**.
- Enter your **Build config name**.
- Mention your **Default branch** which needs to be monitored.
- If you want that besides your default branch, TeamCity should monitor other branches too, define it in the **Branch specification** section.
- Click on **Proceed** button.

### Step 4: Start the build process

- Configure your build setup either **automatically** (fetched by your VCS) or **manually**. For the demo purpose, we will configure the build process manually.

- Enter the **Step name** (optional).
- Select the **Custom Script** in the **Run** field.
- Enter the below mentioned script in the space provided.

```bash
curl -O https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
chmod +x hyperexecute
./hyperexecute --user <your_username> --key <your_access_key> --config <RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE_name>
```

> Since my default agent is mac I am using darwin CLI in the **cURL** command. Kindly change it according to your system default agent. <br /> 
  - **Mac** -> darwin <br />
  - **Linux** -> linux <br />
  - **Windows**-> windows
