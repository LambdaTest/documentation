This post will help you in integrating **Appium Inspector** to interact with **<BrandName />'s Real Devices**.

## Introduction

A **GUI inspector** for mobile apps and more, powered by a (separately installed) **Appium server**. Appium Inspector is an Appium client (like WebdriverIO, Appium's Java client, Appium's Python client, etc) with a User Interface. We can use the interface for specifying Appium Server Version, Setting Capabilities. Once the Appium Server is up & running with the App, we can interact with elements and run other Appium Commands.

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Upload your Application to <BrandName /> Server & Receive the Unique App URL.
2. Run the Test using the Unique App URL.

**TIP**

Please download the latest version of Appium Inspector - 🔗 [Official Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector/releases).

## Starting an Appium Session

### Step 1: Upload your Application.

Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the <BrandName /> servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

  <Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"'
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
```powershell
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Using App URL:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" --location --request POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data-urlencode "url=https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk" --data-urlencode "name=Proverbial_App"
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
```powershell
curl --location --request POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" --data-urlencode "url=https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk" --data-urlencode "name=test" --data-urlencode "custom_id=my_app"
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Check>
**TIP**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on <BrandName /> by using our sample 🔗 [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample 🔗 [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - `lt://APP123456789123456789` and will be used in the next step.
