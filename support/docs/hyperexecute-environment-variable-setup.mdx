To provide you with a secure [cross-browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com) environment on-cloud, we recommend integrating <BrandName /> Authentication Credentials in your test scripts. This would allow our cloud servers to establish a secure connection between your local system and [HyperExecute](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/). This document will help you understand how to set up HyperExecute environment variable for your respective operating system. This set up would also help authenticate your colleague's test cases when executed against an individual account.

## Where to find <BrandName /> Authentication Credentials?
***

<BrandName /> Authentication Credentials consists of two fields:

1. <BrandName /> Username
2. <BrandName /> Access Key

>You can find these authentication credentials by either visiting the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/) or your [<BrandName /> Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).

#**Step 1:** Go to the right side Profile dropdown and select **Account Settings**.

**Step 2:** Under Account Settings, go to **Password & Security**

## Configuring Environment Variables on your Operating System

Before the tests are run, please set the environment variables LT_USERNAME & LT_ACCESS_KEY from the terminal. The account details are available on your [<BrandName /> Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

### Download the HyperExecute CLI

The CLI is used for triggering the tests on HyperExecute. It is recommend to download the CLI binary on the host system and keep it in the root directory of the suite to perform the tests on HyperExecute.
