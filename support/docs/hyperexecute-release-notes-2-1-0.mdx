## Clone your Private Repositories via Tunnel

You can now clone the private repositories from your Git provider that are hosted on a private network or behind a firewall via tunnel.

After specifying the details of your repository, you need to set the useInCodeSetUp flag to true as shown below.

```bash
tunnelOpts:
  useInCodeSetUp: true
## this flag is mandatory to pass to enable cloning via tunnel
```

> Refer to the detailed documentation on [how to clone your private repositories via tunnel](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-configure-tunnel/#clone-a-repository-via-tunnel)
