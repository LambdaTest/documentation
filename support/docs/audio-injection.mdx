Audio Injection allows you to inject microphone input on real iOS devices in the LambdaTest Real Device Cloud.  
Use it to test audio-driven flows such as audio verification and in-app recording—without manual mic input.

## Key Use Cases
- In-app audio recording  
- Audio-based verification/KYC flows  



<Warning>
This feature is currently in Beta. We are actively refining it based on real-world usage and feedback.
</Warning>

## Supported APIs & Devices
- **API:** [AVAudioRecorder](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiorecorder)  
- **Supported Devices:** iOS **14 and above** 

---

## Step 1: Upload Audio File
**Supported formats:** `.mp3`, `.wav`  
**Max size:** 15 MB  , 100 MB respectively

```bash
curl -u "LT_USERNAME:LT_ACCESS_KEY"   -X POST "https://api.lambdatest.com/mfs/v1.0/media/upload"   -F "media_file=@/path/to/test.wav"   -F "type=audio"   -F "custom_id=SampleAudio"
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "media_url": "lt://MEDIAID",
  "status": "success"
}
```

---

## Step 2: Enable Audio Injection via Capabilities

`media` can be set here or injected later in the test.

**Python**
```python
desired_caps = {
  "enableAudioInjection": True,
  "media": "lt://MEDIA123456789"  # optional
}
```

---

## Step 3: Control Audio in Test
Inject the uploaded audio file from LambdaTest into the recorder or app when you are at the dedicated space for microphone input.

**Inject File**
```python
driver.execute_script("lambda-audio-injection=lt://MEDIA123...")
```

<Info>
**NOTE**

The injected audio can come from a standalone audio file **or** from the audio track of a recorded video.
