<Note>
**NOTE :** This documentation is applicable for **Cypress v9** and **previous versions**.
</Note>

HyperExecute is a smart test orchestration platform that allows you to run end-to-end Cypress tests as quickly as possible by providing a test infrastructure with optimal speed, test orchestration, and detailed execution logs.

This guide will cover the basics of getting started with Cypress v9 testing on the HyperExecute.

## Running Cypress v9 Tests on HyperExecute
***

Cypress Tests can be executed on HyperExecute using 2 ways:

1. [**Using Local System**](/support/docs/cypressv9-on-hyperexecute#1-testing-using-local-system) - Requires [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) to execute tests from your Local System. 
2. [**Using Gitpod**](/support/docs/cypressv9-on-hyperexecute#2-testing-using-gitpod) -  Execute tests using GitPod. (Requires a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/login/) account)

## 1. Testing Using Local System
***

### Prerequisites:

To run the Tests on HyperExecute from your Local System, you are required:

- [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-version0.2/) file which contains all the necessary instructions.
- [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) in order to initiate a test execution Job .
- Your lambdatest [Username and Access key](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-get-my-username-and-access-key/)
- Setup the Environmental Variable

<Check>
**SAMPLE REPO**

You can either download or clone the code samples of Cypress v9 from the **LambdaTest's GitHub Repository** to quickly run your tests.

### Execution Methods:
***

Cypress Tests can be executed on HyperExecute using 2 methods:

### 1. Execution Using Auto-Split
***

The Auto-Split mechanism enables you to run tests at predefined concurrency levels and distribute them across available infrastructure. Concurrency can be achieved at various levels, including file, module, test suite, test, and scenario.

<Note>
To learn more about Auto-Split, refer to the [Auto-Split Getting Started Guide](/support/docs/hyperexecute-auto-split-strategy/)
</Note>

#### Core

Auto-split YAML file (*yaml/.hyperexecute_autosplit.yaml*) in the repo contains the following configuration:

```yaml
globalTimeout: 90
testSuiteTimeout: 90
testSuiteStep: 90
```
 
The **`runson`** key determines the platform (or operating system) on which the tests are executed. Here we have set the target OS as Windows.

```yaml
runson: win
```

Auto-split is set to true in the YAML file.

```yaml
 autosplit: true
```

**`retryOnFailure`** is set to true, instructing HyperExecute to retry failed command(s). The retry operation is carried out till the number of retries mentioned in **`maxRetries`** are exhausted or the command execution results in a *Pass*. In addition, the **`concurrency`** (i.e. number of parallel sessions) is set to 2.

```yaml
retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 1
concurrency: 2
```
**`cypress`** is set to true in the YML file.

```yaml
cypress: true
```

Cypress Build name and tags are added in the YML file.

```yaml
cypressOps:
 Build: "Hyperexecute Cypress Sample Build"
 Tags: ["Hyperexecute","Cypress", "Windows", "Autosplit", "V9"]
 BuildTags: ["Hyperexecute-Cypress"]
```

#### Pre Steps

Steps (or commands) that must run before the test execution are listed in the *pre* run step.

```yaml
pre:
  - npm install
```

#### Post Steps

Steps (or commands) that need to run after the test execution are listed in the *post* step. In the example, we *cat* the contents of *yaml/.hyperexecute_autosplit.yaml*

```yaml
post:
  - cat yaml/.hyperexecute_autosplit.yaml
```

The **`testDiscovery`** directive contains the command that gives details of the mode of execution, along with detailing the command that is used for test execution. Here, we are fetching the list of class names that would be further passed in the *testRunnerCommand*

```yaml
testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: static
  command: ls cypress/integration | sed -n 1,'10p'
```

Running the above command on the terminal will give a list of scenarios present in the *feature* files:

* actions.spec.js
* aliasing.spec.js
* assertions.spec.js
* connectors.spec.js
* cookies.spec.js
* local_storage.spec.js
* navigation.spec.js
* querying.spec.js
* sample.spec.js
* spies_stubs_clocks.spec.js

The **`testRunnerCommand`** contains the command that is used for triggering the test. The output fetched from the *testDiscoverer* command acts as an input to the *testRunner* command.

```yaml
testRunnerCommand: npx cypress run  --spec ./cypress/integration/$test --browser=chrome-95.0 --headed --config video=false
```

#### Test Execution

Run the following command on the terminal to trigger the tests as per your machine.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
```bash
./hyperexecute --config yaml/win/.hyperexecute_autosplit.yaml --force-clean-artifacts --download-artifacts
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mac">
```bash
./hyperexecute --config yaml/mac/.hyperexecute_autosplit.yaml --force-clean-artifacts --download-artifacts
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
```bash
./hyperexecute --config yaml/linux/.hyperexecute_autosplit.yaml --force-clean-artifacts --download-artifacts
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Sample YAML File for Auto-Split

```yaml
---
version: 0.1
globalTimeout: 90
testSuiteTimeout: 90
testSuiteStep: 90
retryOnFailure: true
runson: win
cypress: true
maxRetries: 1
concurrency: 2
autosplit: true
# cacheKey: '{{ checksum "package.json" }}'
# cacheDirectories:
#   - node_modules
#   - cypressCache
env:
  CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER: cypressCache
testDiscovery:
  mode: static
  type: raw
  command: ls cypress/integration
testRunnerCommand: npx cypress run  --spec ./cypress/integration/$test --browser=chrome-95.0 --headed --config video=false
cypressOps:
 Build: "Hyperexecute Cypress Sample Build"
 Tags: ["Hyperexecute","Cypress", "Windows", "Autosplit", "V9"]
 BuildTags: ["Hyperexecute-Cypress"]
post:
  - cat ./yaml/win/.hyperexecute_matrix.yaml
pre:
  - npm install

jobLabel: [cypress-v9, win, autosplit]
```

### 2. Execution Using Matrix
***

Matrix-based test execution is used for running the same tests across different test (or input) combinations. The Matrix directive in HyperExecute YAML file is a *key:value* pair where value is an array of strings. Also, the *key:value* pairs are opaque strings for HyperExecute.

<Note>
To learn more about Auto-Split, refer to the [Matrix Getting Started Guide](/support/docs/hyperexecute-matrix-multiplexing-strategy/)
</Note>

#### Core

In the current example, matrix YAML file in the repo contains the following configuration:

```yaml
globalTimeout: 90
testSuiteTimeout: 90
testSuiteStep: 90
```
 
The target platform is set to Win. Please set the **`runso`n** key to **`mac`** if the tests have to be executed on the macOS platform.

```yaml
runson: win
```

The **`matrix`** constitutes of the following entries - *classname*. The entries represent the class names in the test code.

```yaml
matrix:
   os: [win]
   browser: ["chrome-95.0","chrome-96.0","chrome-97.0","chrome-98.0","chrome-99.0","chrome-100.0","chrome-101.0","chrome-102.0","chrome-103.0","chrome-104.0","chrome-105.0"]
   files: ["actions.spec.js", "aliasing.spec.js", "assertions.spec.js", "connectors.spec.js", "cookies.spec.js", "local_storage.spec.js", "navigation.spec.js", "querying.spec.js"]
```

The **`testSuites`** object contains a list of commands (that can be presented in an array). In the current YAML file, commands for executing the tests are put in an array (with a '-' preceding each item). The Maven command *mvn test* is used to run tests located in the current project. In the current project, parallel execution is achieved at the *class* level. The *maven.repo.local* parameter in Maven is used for overriding the location where the dependent Maven packages are downloaded.

```yaml
testSuites:
  - npx cypress run  --spec ./cypress/integration/$files --browser=$browser --headed --config video=false
```

#### Pre Steps

Steps (or commands) that must run before the test execution are listed in the *pre* run step.

```yaml
pre:
  - npm install
```

#### Post Steps

Steps (or commands) that need to run after the test execution are listed in the *post* step. In the example, we *cat* the contents of *yaml/.hyperexecute_matrix.yaml*

```yaml
post:
  - cat yaml/.hyperexecute_matrix.yaml
```

#### Test Execution

Run the following command on the terminal to trigger the tests as per your machine.
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
```bash
./hyperexecute --config yaml/win/.hyperexecute_matrix.yaml --force-clean-artifacts --download-artifacts
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Mac">
```bash

**Step 2:** Login with Lambdatest credentials. You will be redirected to HyperExecute dashboard with pop-up confirming to **'Proceed'** to Gitpod editor in the new tab and current tab will show hyperexecute dashboard.

<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/hyperexecute/frameworks/gitpod_popup.png" alt="Gitpod popup" width="1919" height="878" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 3:** You will need to login into your Gitpod account, or create a new one. <br/>
  (If you are creating a new account, choose your preferred editor. We recommend VS Code)

<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/hyperexecute/frameworks/gitpod2.png" alt="Image" className="doc_img"/>

**Step 4:** As you are running a sample project, Fetching of the Test Scripts, [HyperExecute YAML](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/), [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) and Triggering your tests using the `Execution Command` will be automated. 

**Step 5:** Once you see the `Job Link` in the logs, you can visit the [HyperExecute dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) to see the tests getting executed.


## Additional Details

### Secrets Management

If you want to use any secret keys in the YAML file, this can be set by clicking on the **Secrets** button on the dashboard. All you need to do is create an environment variable that uses the secret key:

```yaml
env:
  PAT: ${{ .secrets.testKey }}
```

### HAR Logs
HAR files are a standardized format for archiving HTTP Archive data. They provide a detailed record of all network requests and responses made by a web browser, including information like URLs, headers, timings, and response data

HAR logs offer a comprehensive view of your application's network activity during testing. This can be helpful for:

- Debugging network-related issues
- Analyzing performance bottlenecks
- Diagnosing Load Order Issues

Network Logs are disabled by default. To enable it, pass the `Network` and `FullHar` capability to `true` in the [`cypressOps`](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#cypressops) flag.

```yaml
cypressOps:
  Network: true
  FullHar: true
```

<Check>
**TIP**

You can download network logs via the Automate Dashboard. You can visualize HAR files using the [HAR Viewer](http://www.softwareishard.com/har/viewer/).
</Check>

### Detailed Cypress Command Logs
<Note>
To enable it for your organization, please contact us via <span className="doc__lt" onClick={() => window.openLTChatWidget()}>**24×7 chat support**</span> or you can also drop a mail to **support@lambdatest.com**.<br />
</Note>

The **Detailed Command Logs** feature can be used to generate a comprehensive record of all Cypress commands and their results, both in the console and in a file. This can be extremely useful for debugging and troubleshooting Cypress tests because it narrows down the logs to reveal specific information. The logs are presented in a human-readable format, making them simple to read and comprehend.

Prerequisite to get the detailed logs in HyperExecute:

```yaml
pre:
  - npm install cypress-terminal-report --save-dev
```

<Check>
**TIP**
