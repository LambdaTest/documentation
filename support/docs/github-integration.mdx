GitHub is one of the most popular community among software developers. It helps you with version control by providing a code hosting platform for all. From open source to business, one can share their codes, discover new ideas and discuss about roadblocks, all in order to deliver a better software. GitHub also serves as a project management tool. It allows a team to collaborate from all around the globe.

The <BrandName /> GitHub Integration allows you to create a card directly in your repository from <BrandName /> platform. Push an issue to your respective repository anytime, even in the middle of your test session. The fields populated by you when marking as bug through <BrandName /> are displayed as information on the bug in GitHub repository for that testing instance.

**GitHub Integration with <BrandName />, like all of our other integrations to 3rd party applications, is available as freemium as well as premium plan.**

**Step 3**: You’ll be redirected to the OAuth permission page. Click on **‘Authorize <BrandName />’**.

<Warning>
**What is OAuth?**<br />
</Warning>
The purpose of OAuth is to bypass the authentication when two different applications interact using their respective APIs. GitHub APIs use OAuth 2.0’s authorization code grant flow for generating access tokens on the user’s behalf.

### How To Integrate GitHub With Your <BrandName /> Account Via Cloud?
***

**Step 1**: Select the radio button on **‘Cloud’**. This will ask you to enter your API token.

<Warning>
**What is an API Token?**
</Warning>
Access tokens are strings with an authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client-server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.
