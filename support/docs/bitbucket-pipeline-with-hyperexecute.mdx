# Bitbucket Pipeline Integration
* * *
Bitbucket Pipelines is a CI/CD service that is built into Bitbucket. It enables you to build, test, and even deploy your code automatically based on a configuration file in your repository.

This document will show you how to integrate Bitbucket Pipelines with HyperExecute to greatly shorten your test cycles

***

### Prerequisites:
-	You need to have a Bitbucket Cloud account.
-	Your workspace must have at least one repository.
 
## How To Integrate Bitbucket Pipeline with Hyperexecute

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Tip>
**Sample repo**

Download or Clone the code sample from the <BrandName /> GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

</Tip>

### 1. Log into your [Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/bundle) cloud account.

## Sample Bitbucket Workflow File

```bash
image: ubuntu:latest  # Adjust for macOS if needed

pipelines:
  default:
    branches:
      - master  # Adjust as needed
    steps:
      ## Download Hyperexecute CLI (descriptive name)
      - name: Download Hyperexecute CLI
        script: |
          wget https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
          chmod u+x hyperexecute

      ## Run Hyperexecute tests (descriptive name)
      - name: Run Hyperexecute Tests
        script: |
          ./hyperexecute --user <your_username> --key <your_access_key> --config <your_yaml_file_path>
```

**Run your tests at speeds never seen before. Happy testing! :)**
