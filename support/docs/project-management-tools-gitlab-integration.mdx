>GitLab is a web-based Git-repository manager with the purpose of facilitating entire DevOps lifecycle. It helps in the collaboration of different teams working on a project. Ensuring Development, QA, Security, Operations and Product team to sync simultaneously on the same project.

**GitLab Integration with <BrandName />, like all of our other integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.**

* **Why do you need to login?**

The purpose of logging in is to bypass the authentication that is applied when two different applications interact using their respective APIs. GitLab APIs uses OAuth 2.0’s [authorization code grant flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) for generating access tokens on user’s behalf.

* **What is an Access token?**

Access tokens are strings with authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.

---

That’s it! Go to Integrations again and you will be able to notice a **green tick** indicating that GitLab is successfully **installed**. You can now experience bug logging in a fly from any of your running test session in <BrandName /> to your repository directly by a single click.

**Note:** Make sure you already have a project in your Gitlab account before you integrate to avoid any issues

### 2. Using Personal Access Token
***
1. Select the radio button on **‘Cloud’** and click **‘Install’**. Here you’ll need to enter your Gitlab API token to validate integration with <BrandName />.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/Gitlab-Integrations-Project-Management-APIs.webp' alt="project management api" width="1350" height="622" />

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/gitlab-accesstoken.webp' alt="access token"  width="1366" height="627" />

4. **"Add a personal access token"** by providing a name for the application. Keep the name that is easy for you to remember as you access token will be derived from it. You can also set an expiry date for that token. Also, select the checkboxes for **‘api’, ‘read_user’ & read_repository** as scopes. These scopes will define the access to authenticate API over Basic OAuth for their respective personal token. After selecting the scopes hit the green button to **"Create personal access token".**

* **What is a Personal Access Token?**

In scenarios where OAuth is excessively utilized, Personal Access Tokens comes to aid in accessing the API. While generating a token, make sure you provide a description that is easy to remember, as your Personal Access Token will be derived from it. Treat this token just as you would treat your own password! Access tokens are strings with authorization key required to access an API. They are issued to the client server and are usually opaque. They are used for requesting access to protected, user-specific resources. Access tokens are vital from a security point of view & can be generated in different formats, depending upon security requirements specified on the resource server.

After you click on **"Create personal access token",** you will get a prompt message saying **"Your new personal access token has been created".** You will find it under the highlighted field.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/project-management-tools-gitlab-integration/Gitlab-Integrations-Project-Management-enter.webp' alt="create token" width="1348" height="627" />

Your **API token** is now ready. Copy the token & store it safely with you, as you will not be able to find it again. Paste the copied token into <BrandName /> GitLab Authentication.
