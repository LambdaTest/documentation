We support all ipa files generated from different Certificates & Profiles.

However, to install these apps on our devices, we resign your applications with our Resigning Certificate.

This is true for all Certificates & Profiles except the applications generated using an Enterprise Account.

## Disabling Re-Signing In Manual App Testing
***

<Info>
- Your application must be an Enterprise Application.

</Info>

When you upload an application that is generated through an Enterprise Account, you have the option at the beginning of your test to disable re-signing by toggling iOS Entitlements.

Once you toggle the iOS Entitlements option, your application's certificates will be preserved.

## Disabling Re-Signing In App Automation
***

<Info>
- Your application must be an Enterprise Application.

</Info>

You can prevent re-signing your application with the "resignApp" capability. Upload your enterprise application & specify the capability as "false" to prevent it from being re-signed.
