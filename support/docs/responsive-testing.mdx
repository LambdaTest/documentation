As the word responsive suggests, this type of testing is used to check the appearance of a website with RWD(Responsive Web Design). This design helps a website render the content in a flexible yet appropriate manner based on the devices & OS on which it gets summoned. At <BrandName />, you can [check RWD](https://www.lambdatest.com/responsive-test-online) through 50+ different devices in a single go!
