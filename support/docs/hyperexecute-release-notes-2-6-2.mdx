## Support for Appium and Maestro Android Emulator
HyperExecute now supports the Appium and the Maestro Android Emulator, providing enhanced flexibility for mobile application testing on Android emulators.

### Key Features:
- **Streamlined Emulator Integration**: Perform testing on virtual devices without requiring physical hardware, reducing setup complexity.
- **Parallel Execution :** Run multiple tests simultaneously on virtual devices using HyperExecute’s parallelism to speed up test cycles and reduce execution time for functional and UI tests.
- **Customizable Capabilities:** Define emulator configurations such as device name, platform version, and orientation directly within your test files.

To execute tests using the Android Emulator, add the following configurations to your `hyperexecute.yaml`:
```yaml
framework:
  args:
    isRealMobile: false
```

> Refer to our detailed documentation for [Appium](/support/docs/hyperexecute-appium-virtual-device/) and [Maestro](/support/docs/hyperexecute-maestro-testing/) on configuring and running tests with Android emulators.
