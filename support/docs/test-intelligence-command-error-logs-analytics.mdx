Command Logs Analytics uses the WebDriver command logs to analyze your failed commands or steps. The WebDriver commands logs are the steps which are executed by the test script during the test execution. To know more about the WebDriver command logs, you can refer to the [W3C Command Logs](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/#endpoints).
