Trello – A project management tool that was acquired by Atlassian in 2017. It helps in project management under agile development. Providing a highly usable dashboard, where you can easily comprehend on who is working on what? Allowing a team to pinpoint the areas where they feel they are missing something out. Team can plan every sprint in an organized manner by creating and updating cards, lists & boards. Along with project management, Trello also aids in effective bug tracking by providing a space where all your bugs can be logged and prioritized according to your release bandwidth.

The Lambdatest Trello Integration allows you to create a card directly in Trello dashboard from Lambdatest platform. Push an issue to your respective project anytime, even in the middle of your test session. The fields populated by you when marking as bug through Lambdatest are displayed as information on the card in Trello dashboard for a testing instance.

* **Why do you require a login with Trello?**

The purpose of logging in is to bypass the authentication that is applied when two different applications interact using their respective APIs.

Trello API make use of token-based authentication for integrating with third-party applications. Once a user clicks on **'Allow'** to grant the third-party application to access user-owned resources from API, then that third-party application is provided a token for communicate with the same on behalf of the user.

Another way through which a client access can authorize is by using basic [OAuth 1.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849).

* **What is Token-based authentication?**

Once the user allows a third-party application to fetch user owned resources from the server to which the third-party application was making requests, then a token gets generated. This token allows third-party application to exchange information with the server API on behalf of the user.

If you are logging into Trello for the first time, then you can generate a token for yourself with the help of API key & the URL:
```javascript
https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=1day&name=MyPersonalToken&scope=read&response_type=token&key={YourAPIKey}
```
