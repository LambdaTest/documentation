# Changing Individual Test Details

* * *

There may be times when you wish to manipulate individual test details from your automation test build while performing automation testing with Selenium Grid on <BrandName />. This document will help you perform basic test operations for a particular test you wish to update.

## Marking Test Status As Pass Or Fail

* * *

While performing automation testing with Selenium on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid, you may face a scenario where a test that you declared as fail in your local instance may turn out to be completed successfully at <BrandName />. Don't worry though! We understand how imperative it is to flag an automation test as either **"pass"** or **"fail"** depending upon your testing requirement with respect to the validation of expected behaviour.

If you wish to mark a test status as fail/pass at <BrandName /> then you can do so by executing the below code:

* To mark test status to **fail**.  

    ```driver.executeScript('lambda-status=failed')```

* To mark test status to **pass**.  

    ```driver.executeScript('lambda-status=passed')```

Here are some newly added status you can use for interpreting test execution results: `skipped`, `ignored`, `unknown`, `error`.

## Renaming Your Test

* * *

Sometimes, you may wish to rename your test, after placing it under execution. You can do that with the help of below code:

```driver.executeScript('lambda-name=Your_test_name')```
