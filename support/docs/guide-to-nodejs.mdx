<BrandName />’s [Selenium grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/why-selenium-grid-is-ideal-for-automated-browser-testing/) enables you to perform end-to-end automation tests on a secure, reliable, and scalable Selenium cloud infrastructure. You can run your Node.js automation test scripts on 3000+ browser and operating system environments giving you higher test coverage and significantly less built times. This document will help you quickly get started with running your Node.js test scripts on the <BrandName /> Selenium automation grid.

## Prerequisites
***

- The first step is to download and install Node.js and node package manager or npm. We recommend using the latest version of node.js.

- You can download it from [official NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

- If you have npm already installed, you may want to upgrade it to the latest version. Here the code you can run in your terminal to upgrade npm.

        npm install npm@latest -g

## Installing Selenium Dependencies For Node.js
***

The next step is to install Selenium dependencies for Node.js using npm. Here’s the command that you can run:

        npm i selenium-webdriver

## Sample Node.js & Selenium Test To Get You Started
***

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you are all set to run your Node.js automation scripts on the <BrandName /> Selenium grid. To get started, you can try out the code below. It’s a simple Node.js script that opens up Google.com, searches <BrandName /> in Google search, and then outputs the search result page's title. You can also fork it from our [Node.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/<BrandName />/nodejs-selenium-sample). Make sure to create the JS file in the same folder where you have downloaded Selenium.

    // setup and build selenium driver object
    const driver = new webdriver.Builder()
        .usingServer(gridUrl)
        .withCapabilities(capabilities)
        .build();
 
    // navigate to a url, search for a text and get title of page
    driver.get('https://www.google.com/ncr').then(function() {
        driver.findElement(webdriver.By.name('q')).sendKeys('TestMu AI\n').then(function() {
            driver.getTitle().then(function(title) {
                setTimeout(function() {
                    console.log(title);
                    driver.quit();
                }, 5000);
            });
        });
    });
}
searchTextOnGoogle();
```
You can execute the test from your terminal through this command.

        node index.js

Do note the use of the remote webdriver here. We have passed browser environment configurations through the capabilities class. You can set the environment details as per your requirements.

To set up your own choice of environment for the test in the code, you can leverage our Capability Generator tool.

<Warning>
**Tear Down**: The tear down method helps the <BrandName /> platform understand when the test’s execution is finished. It’s important to tear down each test, or else it will give timeout errors.
