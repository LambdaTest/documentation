**Applitools** provides an end-to-end software testing platform powered by **Visual AI**. This article will guide you on how to integrate your **Cypress** automation tests with **Applitools** and **<BrandName />**.

## Setting Up Applitools Dependencies And Packages

---

You can download or clone the sample GitHub project from the following repo - [Cypress-<BrandName />-Applitools-Integration](https://github.com/gaurav8760/Cypress-<BrandName />-Applitools-Integration). Navigate to your project directory and follow these steps:

- Install the **NPM dependencies** using the below command:

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Set up **Applitools Eyes** using the below command:

  ```bash
  npx eyes-setup
  ```

- Add the access token of your Applitools account in the `applitools.config.js` file as highlighted in the below screenshot. You can find your **Applitools API** key by logging into your Applitools account and going to your **Profile > My API Key**.

</Warning>


- Install Applitools Eyes dependencies using the below command:

  ```bash
  npm install @applitools/eyes-cypress --save-dev
  ```

  > It will create Applitools Eyes to an Existing Node.js Cypress Project.

## Setting up <BrandName /> CLI and Dependencies

---

- Install the <BrandName /> CLI using below command:

  ```bash
  npm install -g testmu ai-cypress-cli
  ```

- Setup configurations on which you want to run your test using the below command:

  ```bash
  testmu ai-cypress init
  ```

  > It will create a **testmu ai-config.json** file in the root directory of your project.

- Add spec file path in the `run_setting` and your **<BrandName /> credentials** in the auth section of the `testmu ai-config.json` file as shown in the image below.

## Running The Sample Project

---

Execute your first test case using the below command:

```bash
testmu ai-cypress run
```

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/applitools-cypress/applitools3.webp' alt="Image" width="1353" height="622" />

---

> The first test case that you execute will be considered as the base image by default by Applitools.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/applitools-cypress/applitools4.webp' alt="Image" width="1353" height="622" />

---

Edit the URL in the `applitoolsIntegration.spec.js` file and run your second test by using the same run command.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/applitools-cypress/applitools5.webp' alt="Image" width="1353" height="622" />

---

Applitools will compare the base image with this test and highlight the difference.
