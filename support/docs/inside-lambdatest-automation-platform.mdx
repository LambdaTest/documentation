This page gives you a guided walkthrough of all the things on the <BrandName /> [Web Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) and how you can get the most out of the platform, once you have successfully ran you first test.

We provide both Test and Build view for filtering your tests as per your requirement.

## Test Page
Whenever you will click on any of your build or to a particular test, you will be landed on this page. In this page, you will get a detailed information for each of your executed tests like **Build** name, tests configurations (operating system, browser, resolution, browser version etc), command and video logs etc.

### Tests
In the left panel you can observe that it lists all the test cases of a particular build with its corresponding status (pass/fail), execution time, configurations used, and other relevant information.

Additionally, you can sort the data according to date, status, and duration, as well as search for a specific test or apply a filter based on browser, OS, status, and tags.
