## Prerequisites To Run Automation Tests With Selenium & Nightwatch Framework
---
Before getting started with Automated Scripts using Selenium with Nightwatch framework on <BrandName /> Automation, you need to:

* Download and install **NodeJS**. You should be having **NodeJS v6** or newer. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download.
* Make sure you are using the latest version of **JavaScript**.
* Install **npm** from the official website by clicking [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* Download [Selenium JavaScript bindings](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) from the official website. Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your JavaScript automation testing script on <BrandName />’s Selenium Grid.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and tutorial repo

**Step 1:** Clone the <BrandName />’s [nightwatch-selenium-sample repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/nightwatch-selenium-sample) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/nightwatch-selenium-sample
cd nightwatch-selenium-sample
```
**Step 2:** Install the required project dependencies using the command below:
```bash
npm i
```

### Setting up Your Authentication
Make sure you have your <BrandName /> credentials with you to run test automation scripts on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [<BrandName /> Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [<BrandName /> Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

**Step 3:** Set <BrandName /> `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

  <Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
    ```bash
    export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
    export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
    set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Run Your First Test
---
### Sample Test with NightwatchJS
Let’s check out a sample **Nightwatch** framework code running on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. This is a simple Nightwatch automation script that tests a sample to-do list app. The code marks two list items as done, adds a list item and then finally gives the total number of pending items as output.

```javascript title="googleTest.js" reference
var https = require("https");
var lambdaRestClient = require("@lambdatest/node-rest-client");
var lambdaCredentials = {
  username: process.env.LT_USERNAME,
  accessKey: process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY
};
var lambdaAutomationClient = lambdaRestClient.AutomationClient(
  lambdaCredentials
);
module.exports = {
  "@tags": ["test"],
  TodoTest: function(client) {    
    client
      .url("https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/")
      .waitForElementPresent("body", 1000)
      .setValue("input[id=sampletodotext]", "Complete TestMu AI tutorial.")
      .click("input[id=addbutton]")
      .pause(1000)
      .end();  
 
  },
  after: function(browser) {
    console.log("Closing down...");
  },
  afterEach: function(client, done) {
    if (
      process.env.LT_USERNAME &&
      process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY &&
      client.capabilities &&
      client.capabilities["webdriver.remote.sessionid"]
    ) {
      
      lambdaAutomationClient.updateSessionById(
        client.capabilities["webdriver.remote.sessionid"],
        { status_ind: client.currentTest.results.failed ? "failed" : "passed" },
        function(error, session) {
          console.log(error)
          if (!error) {
            client.pause(1000)
            done();
          }
        }
      );
    } else {
      console.log("Test Run Successfully!");
      client.pause(1000)
      done();
    }
  }
};
```
### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities
**Step 4:** Below is the `nightwatch.conf.js` file where we will be declaring the desired capabilities. Since we are using remote webdriver, we have to define which browser environment we want to run the test. We do that by passing browser environment details to <BrandName /> Selenium Grid via desired capabilities class.

```javascript title="nightwatch.conf.js" reference
module.exports = (function(settings) {
  console.log(settings["test_settings"]["default"]["username"]);

  if (process.env.LT_USERNAME) {
    settings["test_settings"]["default"]["username"] = process.env.LT_USERNAME;
  }

  if (process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY) {
    settings["test_settings"]["default"]["access_key"] = process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY;
  }

  if (process.env.SELENIUM_HOST) {
    settings.selenium.host = process.env.SELENIUM_HOST;
  }
  if (process.env.SELENIUM_PORT) {
    settings.selenium.host = process.env.SELENIUM_PORT;
  }
  console.log(settings);
  return settings;
})(require('./nightwatch.json'));
```
<Warning>
You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.
</Warning>

### Executing the Test

**Step 5:** The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command
```bash
npm run single
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [<BrandName /> automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build).

<BrandName /> Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Running Your Parallel Tests Using Nightwatch Framework
---
### Executing Parallel Tests with Nightwatch

To run parallel tests using **Nightwatch**, we would have to execute the below command in the terminal:
```bash
npm run parallel
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [<BrandName /> automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build).

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects
---
You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [<BrandName /> Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using <BrandName /> Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using <BrandName /> Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. <BrandName /> Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

<Note>
Refer our [<BrandName /> Tunnel documentation](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.
</Note>

Here’s how you can establish <BrandName /> Tunnel.

<Note>
Download the binary file of:

- [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
- [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
- [<BrandName /> Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)
</Note>

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **<BrandName /> Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```js
const capabilities = {
        tunnel: true,
}
```
