![api token](/assets/images/project-management-tools-paymo-integration/paymo-api-token.webp)

<Warning>
**What is an API token?**
When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.
</Warning>

**Step 5:** You can find your API token from your **Paymoapp** instance. If you have not generated one before, you can generate an API token by going to the **settings.** The settings icon will be visible once you hover the mouse on the bottom left side where your name and display image is placed. We have highlighted the part you need to hover in red. Click on the settings icon.

**Step 6:** As you click on settings icon, go to **"Your Settings".**

![settings](/assets/images/project-management-tools-paymo-integration/paymo-settings.webp)

![app password](/assets/images/project-management-tools-paymo-integration/paymo-apppassword.webp)

You can keep a note of this API token with you for future authentication. Although, in case you forget to do so, or you end up neglecting it due to some reason. Then there is no need to panic! You can create a new token by defining a new label. You can also **delete** a previously declared API Key, in case you feel that your API Key has been placed in some wrong hands. You can delete an API Key by hovering over the label and clicking on the **bin** icon.

![api token](/assets/images/project-management-tools-paymo-integration/paymo-apitoken.webp)

**Step 9:** Paste the API token into the field provided at Lambdatest & hit the **‘Next’** button. You are all set to experience **one-click bug** logging to share your issues directly from your Lambdatest account to your project on Paymo.
