XML reports provide a detailed summary of test execution, allowing you to better understand your test outcomes. This document aims to guide you through the process of retrieving XML reports for XCUI tests executed on the <BrandName /> platform.

## Objective
---
### By the end of this document, you should be able to:

1. Fetch XML reports for non-shard XCUI builds.

2. Fetch XML reports for shard builds, both for individual shards and all shards collectively.

## XML report APIs
----

**Non-shard build :** 
To fetch the XML report for a `non-shard` build, you can use the following cURL command:

```bash

curl --location "https://mobile-api.lambdatest.com/mobile-automation/api/v1/framework/builds/<build_id>/report/?encoder=false" \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <Base64 Authentication>'

```

**Shard build (For single shard):**
To fetch the XML report for a `single shard` in a shard build,use:

```bash

curl --location 'https://mobile-api.lambdatest.com/mobile-automation/api/v1/framework/jobs/<job_id>/report/?shard=<shard_id>&encoder=false' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <Base64 Authentication>'

```

**Shard build (For all the shards):**
To fetch the XML reports for `all shards` in a shard build, use:

```bash

curl --location 'https://mobile-api.lambdatest.com/mobile-automation/api/v1/framework/jobs/<job_id>/report/?encoder=false' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic <Base64 Authentication>'

```

<Note>
- Authenticate the API using your <BrandName /> username and access key, and replace `build_id`, `job_id` and `shard_id` for which you want to fetch report.**

- It is recommended to run the sharding test(via HyperExecute CLI) in the verbose mode i.e. with the **--verbose** flag. This allows the shard ID(task ID) and build ID(Job ID) to be displayed in the logs and then they can be used to fetch the above reports.
- In case the report is not a valid XML format, the `encoder=true` parameter can be utilized to prevent the decoding of certain characters. Decoding is usually performed at the server's end to enhance the readability of the report.
