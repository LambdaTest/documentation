## Infrastructure Improvement for Autoscaling

HyperExecute continuously strives to enhance its autoscaling infrastructure to ensure optimal resource allocation and seamless test execution. This release introduces significant infrastructure improvements that elevate autoscaling efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and reliability.

### Key Infrastructure Enhancements

- **Optimized Instance Selection:** HyperExecute now employs intelligent algorithms to select the most suitable instance types based on real-time workload demands, maximizing resource utilization and cost-efficiency.

- **Automated Instance Termination:** Idle instances are automatically identified and terminated, preventing unnecessary resource consumption and optimizing infrastructure costs.

- **Enhanced Load Balancing:** Load balancing strategies are refined to distribute traffic across multiple instances effectively, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring optimal resource utilization.
