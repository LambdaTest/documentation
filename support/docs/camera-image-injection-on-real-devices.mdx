<BrandName />'s Media Injection empowers you to test various camera-related functionalities (Image Injection and Video Injection) of your app across a vast array of real mobile devices. This innovative feature supports image capture testing, QR code scanning verification and Barcode scanning assessment.

## Use Cases

- URL-embedded QR code scans
- Digital check processing
- Real-time video streaming and playback
- Video capture and upload workflows

## How It Works

The Image and Video Injection processes leverages **Sensor Instrumentation** technology. When activated for a test session, it injects <BrandName />'s proprietary camera module into your application and emulates or supersedes the native Android/iOS camera SDK

### Key Features

- Extensive device compatibility (10000+ real devices)
- Comprehensive support for image and video based functionalities
- Effortless integration with existing test environments

<Warning>
- For iOS apps signed with Enterprise Certificates, app resigning (a prerequisite for using the Image Injection tool) is not available.
</Warning>

**Step 6:** Now go to camera feature in your app, the camera pops up. When you click the image from your app, you will see a black image. Please proceed with the same by clicking on **Use Photo**. 

**Step 7:** The black image is now replaced with an injected image or video.

<Info>
**The clicked image is black because the **Cameras** of <BrandName /> Real Devices are taped for security reasons. Thus we inject image through **Sensor Instrumentation**.**
