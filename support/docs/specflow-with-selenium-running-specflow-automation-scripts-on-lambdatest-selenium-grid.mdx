In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your C# automation testing scripts on [LambdaTest Selenium cloud platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using **C#** framework **SpecFlow**.

## Objective
---

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Set up an environment for testing your hosted web pages using **SpecFlow** framework with **Selenium**.
2. Understand and configure the core capabilities required for your Selenium test suite.
3. Run test cases in parallel using **SpecFlow** with **Selenium** to reduce build times.
4. Test your locally hosted pages on LambdaTest platform.
5. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

<Note>
**Note:** All the code samples in this documentation can be found in the [LambdaTest's Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LambdaTest/SpecFlow-Selenium-Sample). You can either download or clone the repository to quickly run your tests.
</Note>

## Prerequisites For Running SpecFlow Selenium
---
<Note>
**Note:** This tutorial is specifically for Windows users using **Microsoft Visual Studio**.
</Note>

Before you can start performing **SpecFlow** automation testing with **Selenium**, you would need to:

* Download and Install **Selenium WebDriver** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).
* Make sure you work with latest version of **SpecFlow**.
* **.Net** framework to deliver guidelines while developing a range of application using C#.
* Download [Selenium WebDriver Language Binding](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) for C# and extract them to appropriate folder. A [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) of 2.1 or greater version.
* You would also need LambdaTest tunnel binary file for testing your locally hosted or privately hosted projects.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and Tutorial Repo

**Step 1:** Clone the [LambdaTest’s SpecFlow-Selenium-Sample repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/SpecFlow-Selenium-Sample) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:
```csharp
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/SpecFlow-Selenium-Sample
cd SpecFlow-Selenium-Sample
```
### Setting up Your Authentication
Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts with C# on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/login) or through LambdaTest Profile.

**Step 2:** Set LambdaTest Username and Access Key in environment variables.

 * For Linux/macOS:
 `export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`
 * For Windows:
 `set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"`

## Run Your First Test

### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities

**Step 3:** n the test script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:
```csharp 
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.BrowserName, "Chrome");
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.Version, "96");
            capabilities.SetCapability(CapabilityType.Platform, "Windows 10");
```
<Note>
**Note:** You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt [Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/).
</Note>

### Executing Your First Test 

**Step 4:** Build the solution by clicking in **Build > Build Solution.** 

**Step 5:** As shown below click on **Test Explorer** on your MS Visual Studio:
![cmd](/assets/images/uploads/Test-Explorer-Screen.webp)

**Step 6:** Click on **Run** from the Test Explorer to run the sample test as shown below:
![cmd](/assets/images/uploads/SpecFlowTest.webp)

Your results would be displayed on the test console and on the LambdaTest dashboard. [LambdaTest Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/) will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire Selenium tests.

## Running Your Parallel Tests Using SpecFlow Testing Framework
---
### Executing the Test
To run parallel tests, you may go to **Test Explorer** on Visual Studio as mentioned above and click on **Run All** tests to execute the tests. Your results would be displayed on the test console and on the [LambdaTest dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/). LambdaTest Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire Selenium tests.

## Testing Locally Hosted Projects Using MSTest Selenium
---
You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

<Note>
Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.
</Note>

Here’s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

<Note>
Download the binary file of:
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)
</Note>

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```bash
DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
            capabilities.SetCapability("tunnel", true);
```
