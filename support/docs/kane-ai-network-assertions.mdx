# Network Logs Assertions
The **Network Logs Assertions** feature in KaneAI enables you to test and validate the behavior of your application at the **network layer**.  
This is useful when you need to ensure that API calls, response codes, payloads, or request timings meet expected conditions during your test executions.  

# Let's see how to add Network Logs Assertions in a Test

- **Start a test session** (Desktop or Mobile Web). 

- All network calls are automatically recorded in the background as you navigate through your application, you can see the Network calls made so far through the **Assert Network Logs** option available in the " / " commands.

- Here you will find all the Network requests made in this session so far and **having the Json data format**, you can filter the requests on basis of **Status Code** or **HTTP Methods**:

- Select the specific key's that you want to add in the assertion from the **Request Headers**.

- To add **Request** or **Response blocks** in assertions click on the `Add Assertion` button. All the chosen values will be validated in a single step.

- Once added, the request will be stored as a **variable**. KaneAI then makes assertions based on this variable.

#### How to validate a specific object in request or response of an API?

- You can reuse the request later in your test using the familiar `{{variable}}` syntax.

- The stored variable is in **JSON format**, so you can easily access nested values with dot-notation (e.g., `header.status`).
