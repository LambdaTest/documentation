## How To Integrate Lambdatest With Katalon?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For integrating Lambdatest with Katalon, make sure to run your test scripts through the ‘Remote’ desired capability. You can select all your desired capabilities from [Lambdatest Capabilities Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/).

**Step 1:** Login to Lambdatest. If you haven’t signed up yet, click [here](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register).

**Step 2:** Visit your Profile on Lambdatest to fetch your Username and Access Key value.

**Step 3:** You would require these values for generating a secure remote connection with Katalon through Lambdatest remote URL.

```json
Remote URL = "http://username:accessKey@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub" 
 
/* Below is an example remote URL based on the image shared above in Step 2.*/
 
Example remote URL = "http://harshitp:ABCD1234PQRS@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"
```

**Step 4:** Visit Lambdatest Capabilities Generator for declaring desired capabilities. For instance, if you wish to test on macOS High Sierra using Firefox browser then desired capabilities for Java frameworks would look like below.

Once you select ‘Remote’ and provide the basic parameters then you only need to execute your automation tests. You can do that by going to Action → Run → Remote.
