The [<BrandName /> Tunnel](/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) feature enables you to perform secure and real-time testing of locally hosted websites, private servers, and web applications that are behind a corporate firewall. By creating a secure connection between your local environment and the <BrandName /> cloud, the Tunnel allows you to access and test internal applications on various browsers and devices.

## Use Cases
- **Testing Locally Hosted Websites :** Useful for validating websites or web applications still in the development phase that are hosted on a local machine or development server.
- **Testing Staged Applications :** Ideal for testing applications hosted in staging environments that are not yet deployed to production.
- **Testing Web Apps Behind a Corporate Firewall :** Allows you to securely access and test applications that are protected by a corporate firewall.
- **End-to-End Testing in CI Environments :** Facilitates end-to-end testing scenarios that require access to local databases, APIs, or other internal services.
