## MITM Support in Emulators
We’ve added Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) proxy support in HyperExecute Emulators.

- You can now capture network logs directly from emulator sessions using MITM.
- This feature is available for all emulators when configured with a flag that you can add in your `hyperexecute.yaml` file:

```yaml title="hyperexecute.yaml"
framework:
  name: raw
  args:
    mitmProxy: true
```

This enhancement enables deeper debugging of API calls, request/response payloads, and overall network traffic during test execution.

{/* ## Enhancement: Error Messages on JMeter Dashboard
We’ve improved the JMeter Dashboard experience for better visibility into failed or incomplete jobs.
- If a JMeter job ends in a non-Completed status, a mini error message bar will now be displayed.
- The bar shows the job remark, consistent with how other HyperExecute job types surface error messages.

This update ensures quicker debugging and a more consistent user experience across dashboards.

## Enhancement: Retry Visibility in HyperExecute Reports
We’ve enhanced the HyperExecute Report to give better visibility into retries at both the summary and test level.

- **Total Counts Refined :** The “No. of Scenarios” and “No. of Tests” metrics will now display values excluding retries.
- **Retry Indicators :** A retry icon and the number of retried tests/scenarios are displayed alongside the counts, similar to the Task Summary section.
- **Test Case Details :** In the “Test Cases” view, retried tests are now clearly marked with a retry icon.

This update ensures accurate reporting and makes it easier to differentiate between unique executions and retries.

## Muted Test Count & Bulk Unmute Option
We’ve enhanced the Test Muting functionality in HyperExecute with improved visibility and control:

- **Total Muted Test :** The dashboard now shows the number of muted test cases in your suite.
- **Unmute All :** You can now unmute all tests at once instead of manually unmuting them one by one.

This update streamlines test management and makes it easier to re-enable muted tests when they are ready to be executed again.
