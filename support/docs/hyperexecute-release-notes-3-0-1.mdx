## Workflow Variables on HyperExecute
With Workflow Variables, you can now customize your workflow execution. This makes it easier to reuse the same workflow across multiple scenarios without editing YAML or creating duplicate workflows.

- **Workflow-level Variables :** Define reusable variables (e.g., ENVIRONMENT, BROWSER) while creating or editing workflows.
- **Default & Multiple Values :** Assign defaults or provide multiple values per variable.
- **Runtime Overrides :** Update variable values at run time without changing saved defaults.
