**Visual Studio App Center** is an integrated mobile development lifecycle solution for iOS, Android, Windows and macOS apps. It brings together multiple services commonly used by mobile developers, including build, test, distribute, monitoring, diagnostics, etc., into one single integrated cloud solution. 

It can be used to decrease the manual effort of uploading the app & **automate** the process.
