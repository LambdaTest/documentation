## Configure the behavior of Error Categorization of Your Job!!

The `errorCategorizedOnFailureOnly` flag lets you control when error categorization happens after a job runs. Normally, errors are categorized for every stage, even if the stage succeeded. Enabling this flag ensures that errors are only categorized for stages that failed (not green).

<Note>
Refer to the documentation for more details on the [errorCategorizedOnFailureOnly](/support/docs/deep-dive-into-hyperexecute-yaml/#errorcategorizedonfailureonly)
