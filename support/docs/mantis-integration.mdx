<Warning>
 **What is an API token?**
 When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.

**What is Mantis Site Address?**
Your "Mantis Site Address" would be the URL for the instance of your project on Mantishub. The part highlighted with blue in the below image will be your Mantis Site Address.

</Warning>

![Mantis integration API](/assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-8.webp)

<Note>
  Note: These API tokens should be treated as safely as you treat your own
  passwords, as they are responsible for successful authentication between one
  application to another. However, in case your API token gets misplaced or is
  shared with someone whom you don’t trust, then you can always revoke access
  through that API token through your MantisHub instance. You can also generate
  multiple API tokens.
</Note>
