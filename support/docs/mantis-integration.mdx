## How To Establish Integration With Mantis From Your <BrandName /> Account?
* * *
**Step 1:** Login to your <BrandName /> account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select ‘Integrations’ from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your <BrandName /> account.

**Step 3:** Click on ‘ADD’ under the block that says ‘Mantis’.

**Step 4:** Once you click on install, you will be redirected to the below screen. You will be asked to provide your Mantis API Token & Mantis Site Address in the highlighted fields to establish <BrandName /> Integration with Mantis.

<Note>
**What is an API token?**
</Note>
When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.

<Note>
**What is Mantis Site Address?**
</Note>
Your "Mantis Site Address" would be the URL for the instance of your project on Mantishub. The part highlighted with blue in the below image will be your Mantis Site Address.

**Step 5:** To find the API token, login to your MantisHub account. Go to the ‘administrator’ drop-down on the top-right corner and click on "My Account".

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-5.webp' alt="create api mantis" width="1364" height="649" />

**Step 6:** As you click on "My Account", you will find a tab for "API Tokens". Enter a value in the provided field. It could be any value you like and then click on the button that says "Create API Token".

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-6.webp' alt="Mantis integration Token" width="1365" height="649" />

**Step 7:** As you click on "Create API Token", an API token would be generated. Keep the API token stored with you safely as you won’t be able to see it again.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-8.webp' alt="mantis integration api" width="1364" height="648" />

<Note>
Note: These API tokens should be treated as safely as you treat your own passwords, as they are responsible for successful authentication between one application to another. However, in case your API token gets misplaced or is shared with someone whom you don’t trust, then you can always revoke access through that API token through your MantisHub instance. You can also generate multiple API tokens.
</Note>

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/mantis-integration/mantis-integration-4-2.webp' alt="mantis integration account" width="1365" height="649" />

Paste this API token into the field provided at <BrandName /> & hit the ‘Next’ button. You are all set to experience one-click bug logging to share your issues directly from your <BrandName /> account to your project on Mantis.
