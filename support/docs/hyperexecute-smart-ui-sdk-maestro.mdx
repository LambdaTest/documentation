This document guides you on how to perform visual regression testing for your Android applications by running your Maestro tests on the HyperExecute platform and capturing screenshots with the SmartUI SDK.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* Your <BrandName /> Username and Access Key. You can find these on your dashboard -> left side bar -> credentials.
* The [HyperExecute CLI](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/) downloaded to your local machine.
* An existing Android application file (`.apk`).
* Node.js and npm installed on your system.

## Step 1: Create a SmartUI Project

First, you need to create a project in SmartUI. All your visual regression test builds for this project will be grouped here.

1.  Navigate to the [SmartUI Projects page](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/).
2.  Click on **New Project**.
3.  Select **CLI** as the platform.
4.  Provide a **Project Name**, select approvers, and add any relevant tags.
5.  Click **Submit**.

<Info>
**Once the project is created, you will get a unique `PROJECT_TOKEN`. Copy this token as it is required in the HyperExecute YAML configuration file later.**

</Info>

## Step 2: Clone The Sample Repository

You can configure your own existing Maestro project or get started quickly by cloning our sample repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TestMu AI/smartui-maestro-sample
cd smartui-maestro-sample
```

<Tip>
**Sample Repo**

You can find the complete code for this example in the following <BrandName /> GitHub repository.

</Tip>

## Step 3: Upload Your Application

To run your tests on <BrandName /> real devices or emulators, you need to upload your Android app (`.apk`) and get an `appId`.

Run the following `cURL` command in your terminal. Ensure you have set your `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` as environment variables.

```bash

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"<YOUR_LOCAL_APP_PATH>"" -F "name="sampleApp""
`}

```

From the JSON response, copy the value of `app_url`. It will be in the format `lt://...`. This is your `appId`.

## Step 4: Configure Your Test Suite

Now, let's set up the test suite to integrate with SmartUI.

#### 4.1. Install SmartUI CLI

The SmartUI CLI is required to capture and upload screenshots. Install it in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @lambdatest/smartui-cli
```

<Note>
**If you face any problems executing tests with SmartUI-CLI `versions >= v4.x.x`, upgrade your Node.js version to `v20.3` or above.**

</Note>

#### 4.2. Add SmartUI Screenshots to Your Maestro Flow

In your Maestro test YAML files (e.g., `maestro-test/test.yaml`), add the `takeScreenshot` command wherever you want to capture a visual checkpoint. The `path` specified will be used to name the screenshot in the SmartUI dashboard.

```yaml
- launchApp
- takeScreenshot:
    path: ./screenshots/home-screen
- tapOn: "Login"
- takeScreenshot:
    path: ./screenshots/login-page
```

#### 4.3. Set Up Environment Variables

Now, you need to export your environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [<BrandName /> Username and Access Key Page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security/username-accesskey).

Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

<Tabs className="docs__val">
<Tab title="Linux / MacOS">

  ```bash

  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">

  ```powershell

  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Configure the HyperExecute YAML

The HyperExecute YAML file is the blueprint for your test execution. It tells HyperExecute how to set up the environment and run your tests.

You need to add your `PROJECT_TOKEN` (from Step 1) and your `appId` (from Step 3) to the YAML file. Below are example configurations for running Maestro tests on Emulators and Real Devices.

<Tabs className="docs__val">
<Tab title="Android-Real Device">

```yaml reference title="maestro_Real_Devices.yaml"
https://github.com/TestMu AI/smartui-maestro-sample/blob/main/yaml/maestro_Real_Devices.yaml
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Android-Emulator">

```yaml reference title="maestro_Emulator_HyperEx.yaml"
https://github.com/TestMu AI/smartui-maestro-sample/blob/main/yaml/maestro_Emulator_HyperEx.yaml
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Info>
**In the real device configuration, the `testDiscovery` and `testRunnerCommand` are handled internally by the `maestro` framework integration on HyperExecute. You just need to specify the `framework` block.**

</Info>

## Step 6: Execute Your Test Suite

Run the below command in your terminal at the root folder of the project:

```bash
./hyperexecute --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

OR use this command if you have not exported your username and access key in the step 2.

```bash

    {`./hyperexecute --user ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} --key ${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()} --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE `}
  
```

## Step 7: View Your Visual Test Results on SmartUI

After the HyperExecute job is finished, all screenshots captured using the `takeScreenshot` command will be available in your SmartUI project for review.

1.  Navigate to the [SmartUI Dashboard](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/).
2.  Select your project and the most recent build.
3.  Here, you can compare screenshots against the baseline, highlight differences, and approve or reject changes. You can use features like Smart Ignore to mask dynamic areas for more stable comparisons.
