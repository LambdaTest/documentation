YouTrack is a bug tracking and project management tool developed by JetBrains. It allows you to create agile boards, use reports and Gantt charts, dashboards, and time tracking. With YouTrack, you can find issues easily based on autocomplete queries and manipulate them in batches, customize all problem attributes, and create custom workflows.

With Lambdatest and YouTrack integration, you can push bugs directly from Lambdatest to your YouTrack's project. Also, capture screenshots, annotate bugs, and share them with your teammates and colleagues.

    An API token is required to authenticate a user's identity from one server to another by retrieving client resources from the server where the connection is initiated. To ensure its security and data integrity, API tokens are important when an end user connects into an application via a two-step verification process.
