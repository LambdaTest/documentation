PagerDuty is a bug tracking platform that uses machine learning and automation to notify clients of interrupts and failures. These flaws are discovered in real-time, informing the appropriate people to react to any issue as quickly as possible to avoid them in the future.

With <BrandName /> and PagerDuty integration, you can log issues directly while perform [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/) of your websites (and web apps) from the <BrandName /> platform to PagerDuty.

## Integrating PagerDuty With <BrandName />

*   **What is a PagerDuty Token?**<br />
The PagerDuty REST API supports authentication through an account or user API token. Account API tokens have read-only access to all data on an account and can be granted full read, write, update, and delete access. User API tokens for PagerDuty accounts with Advanced Permissions have access to all the linked user account's data.

### Getting the PagerDuty Token
