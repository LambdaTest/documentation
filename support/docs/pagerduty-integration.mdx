PagerDuty is a bug tracking platform that uses machine learning and automation to notify clients of interrupts and failures. These flaws are discovered in real-time, informing the appropriate people to react to any issue as quickly as possible to avoid them in the future.

With Lambdatest and PagerDuty integration, you can log issues directly while perform [cross browser testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/) of your websites (and web apps) from the Lambdatest platform to PagerDuty.

User API tokens for PagerDuty accounts with Advanced Permissions have access to all the linked user account's data.
