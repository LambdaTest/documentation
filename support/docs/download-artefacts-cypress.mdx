This article guides you on how to download the artefacts for a Cypress project from <BrandName /> Cloud machine.

<Tip>
**Sample repo**

In this demo we are demonstrating using <BrandName />'s sample Cypress Cloud repo. You can find all the resources used for this article in the linked repo. <a href="https://github.com/<BrandName />/Cypress-Cloud" className="github__anchor"><img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/icons/github.png' alt="Image" /> View on GitHub</a>

## Downloading The Data From The <BrandName /> Cloud Machine

---

Assuming that you have run a Cypress test on testmu ai platform ( if not, this article [here](/support/docs/getting-started-with-cypress-testing/) will guide you in running your first Cypress test on <BrandName />), you need to follow these steps below:

### Update <BrandName /> Cypress CLI

---

Before getting started, you would have to update the **testmu ai-cypress cli** using the command below:

```bash
npm install -g testmu ai-cypress-cli
```

### Add downloads Capability

---

Add **"downloads"** capability in the `testmu ai-config.json` file and define the files/directories that you wanted to download in this capability. You can mention multiple file paths in this capability separated by a comma. Refer to the below example for the same.

### Add --sync Flag

---

Append `–-sync` flag in the run command as mentioned below and run your test on the <BrandName /> platform. 

```bash
testmu ai-cypress run --sync=true
```

Once the test gets executed, you will find a `build_id` on the console corresponding to the executed test.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress5.png' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" />

### Get session_id In lambdatest_run.json
---

Go to your `lambdatest_run.json` file and copy the `session_id`.

```json title=lambdatest_run.json
{
   "build_id": "7724863",
   "session_id": "6c899177-047e-4432-a9a7-17776e23aae3"
}
```

Now pass the session_id by running the following command.

```json
testmu ai-cypress generate-report --session_id 6c899177-047e-4432-a9a7-17776e23aae3
```

### View The Downloaded Folder
---

- A new folder with the name **testmu ai-artifacts** will get created in the **root** directory of your project and all the files will be downloaded in this folder.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/cypress/cypress6.png' alt="Image" width="1282" height="722" />

- The file name will be created with the session_id combined with the browser name, browser version, and the test id corresponding to it.
