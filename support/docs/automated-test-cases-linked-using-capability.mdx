Test Manager supports linking automated test runs directly to specific test cases using Test Case IDs. This feature enables better traceability and management of your automated testing workflow.

<Warning>
Currently, this feature is supported on [HyperExecute](/support/docs/getting-started-with-hyperexecute/) and Web Automation tests.
</Warning>

## How to Link a Test Case ID

To link an automated test run with a specific test case, add the `tms.tc_id` key in the `lt:Options` section of your test capabilities. Here is a sample configuration demonstrating how to include the `tms.tc_id` key in your script:

```javascript
const capabilities = {
  "lt:Options": {
      "tms.tc_id": "TC-1470" // Link the test execution to the Test Case ID 'TC-1470'
  }
};
```

- `lt:Options` : A JSON object containing additional options for <BrandName /> configurations.
- `tms.tc_id` : The key used to link a test case in Test Manager. Replace "TC-1470" with your desired Test Case ID.


<Note>
**NOTE**

- Ensure the Test Case ID exists in Test Manager before linking.  
- The Test Case ID format should match exactly as shown in Test Manager
- Each automated test run can be linked to one test case at a time
