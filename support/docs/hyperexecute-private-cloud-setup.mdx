# HyperExecute Private Cloud

HyperExecute offers you the possibility to complete your test execution process at the highest speeds possible, even on your own private cloud. 

This allows you to have complete control over your testing infrastructure. With this added flexibility, you can run your tests on your own terms, while being completely comfortable with the security of your data. It is an enterprise-ready solution that can be modified to support the unique wants of your organization. 

With [smart features](/support/docs/key-features-of-hyperexecute/) such as auto-grouping, auto-retry, and fail-fast mechanisms, HyperExecute takes away all the pain to run tests leaving the developers or testers to focus on other important tasks.
