# Set Device Date & Time

<BrandName /> now supports configuring custom **date**, **time**, and **hour-format** on Real Devices via Appium during automation testing sessions. This allows developers and testers to simulate specific date/time conditions to validate use cases like scheduled events, alarms, chats, or localization for time formats.

By the end of this document, you will be able to:
- Set a specific date and time on the device
- Toggle between 12-hour and 24-hour formats
- Enable/disable automatic time syncing with network settings

## Support for Automation on Real Devices

To modify the date and time settings programmatically, use the `lambda_executor` Appium hook with the `updateDeviceSettings` action. You can provide multiple arguments including custom date, time, format toggle, and auto-time setting.

---
## Supported Arguments

| Argument           | Format        | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `customDate`       | `MMM DD YYYY` | Sets the device date. You can select a date up to **7 days** from today.    |
| `customTime`       | `HH:MM`       |  Sets time in 24-hour format `(e.g., 13:30)`. Display adapts based on `twelveHourTime` (shown as `1:30 PM` if enabled).|
| `twelveHourTime`   | `On` / `Off`  | `On` for 12-hour, `Off` for 24-hour format.                                 |
| `setAutomatically` | `On` / `Off`  | Enables or disables syncing with network time.                              |

> 💡 **Note:** When `setAutomatically` is turned **On**, all Other Arguments for  **Date and Time**  are automatically disabled on the device.
