issues directly to your GitHub repository from the <BrandName /> platform.

## Integrating Your GitHub Account Using Repo-Based OAuth

**Step 2:** Navigate to **Integrations** from the left-sidebar under **Settings**.

**Step 3:** Click on **Project Management**, then click **Connect** on the GitHub card.

**Step 6:** Choose the installation location. Instead of granting access to all GitHub repositories, you also have the option to select a specific repository for installing the <BrandName /> App.

After selecting the installation location, click **Request** to get the approval for the repository authorization.
