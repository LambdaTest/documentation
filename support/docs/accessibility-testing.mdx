## What is Accessibility Testing?

Accessibility testing is the process of evaluating and improving web apps, websites, and mobile apps to ensure they are usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities.

This includes people with:

- **Visual impairments:** Blindness, low vision, color blindness.
- **Motor impairments:** Difficulty using a mouse or keyboard, relying on assistive technologies.
- **Hearing impairments:** Deafness, hearing loss, relying on captions and transcripts.
- **Cognitive impairments:** Difficulty focusing, understanding complex information, needing simpler interfaces.

## Why Accessibility Testing is Important?

<Note>
INFO <br />
Based on [**WebAIM's research**](https://webaim.org/projects/million/), there is a significant disparity in digital inclusivity, with **95.9%** of the top 1 million websites not meeting basic accessible standards. This disparity highlights the importance of accessibility testing to ensure digital spaces are accessible to all.
</Note>

The following explains why accessibility testing is essential:

- **Meeting Accessibility Standards:** Ensuring your platform meets essential accessibility guidelines such as WCAG, ADA, and Section 508 not only reduces legal risks but also supports inclusivity and provides equal access for all users.
- **Digital Inclusivity:** Users with disabilities can access content, eliminating barriers for those with visual, auditory, or motor impairments.
- **Wider Audience Reach:** Over 2 billion people worldwide live with impairments. By using accessibility testing, you can reach this untapped market and grow your clientele.
- **Improved Usability for All Users:** Features like enhanced colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and alternate text make your website easier to use for all users.
- **Future-Proofing Your Digital Presence:** Using inclusive design now guarantees that your platform will remain ahead of the curve and relevant as accessibility standards change.

## The European Accessibility Act (EAA)

<Warning>
The [European Accessibility Act (EAA)](https://accessible-eu-centre.ec.europa.eu/content-corner/news/eaa-comes-effect-june-2025-are-you-ready-2025-01-31_en), effective from June 2025, is a groundbreaking regulation made to improve accessibility across the European Union. This act guarantees the accessibility of digital products and services to all individuals, including the 135 million people living with disabilities in the EU. It gives businesses a clear requirement to design products and services that are accessible to everyone, breaking down digital barriers and inclusivity.
</Warning>

### Scope of the EAA

The EAA applies to a wide range of digital products and services, including:

- **Digital Content:** Websites, mobile applications, and electronic documents.
- **Consumer Devices:** Computers, smartphones, e-readers, and television equipment.
- **Public Services:** ATMs, ticketing machines, and other self-service terminals.
- **Financial Services:** Online banking platforms, investment services, and related digital processes.

## Accessibility Laws and Compliances

Ensuring accessibility compliance is not just good practice but a legal necessity. Several laws mandate accessibility standards to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities:

- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG):** These guidelines are internationally recognized and provide recommendations to make web content more accessible. They are often referenced by many laws and set the standard for compliance.
- **American Disabilities Act (ADA):** Ensures U.S. websites and digital platforms are accessible to people with disabilities. Non-compliance can result in legal actions, fines, and reputational damage.
- **Section 508 (Rehabilitation Act):** Mandates that federal agencies and contractors provide accessible electronic information technology, including websites and apps, to individuals with disabilities.
- **Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA):** A Canadian law that requires businesses in Ontario to ensure that their websites and online services are accessible to individuals with disabilities.

## Use Cases of Accessibility Testing

Accessibility testing is essential for all businesses striving to create inclusive digital experiences. Below are some key areas where accessibility testing can make a significant impact:

- **E-commerce Websites:** All users can seamlessly browse products, add items to their cart, and complete the checkout process.
- **Government Websites:** Public services are accessible to all citizens, including those with disabilities.
- **Mobile Apps:** Mobile apps offer a smooth and navigable experience for all users.
- **Educational Platforms:** Helps students access learning materials, participate in discussions, and complete assignments without barriers.
