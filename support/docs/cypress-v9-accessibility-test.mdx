This document walks you through the step by step guide for executing the automation tests of your website with <BrandName />'s Accessibility Tool using Cypress v9 and below.

<Warning> **NOTE:** This documentation is applicable for **Cypress v9** and **previous versions**.</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- Your [<BrandName /> Username and Access key](/support/docs/using-environment-variables-for-authentication-credentials/)
- Setup your local machine as per your testing framework.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Trigger Your Test

### Step 1: Setup Your Test Suite

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Check> 
**SAMPLE REPO** <br />
Download or Clone the code sample from the <BrandName /> GitHub repository to run your tests.

<GitHubButton url="https://github.com/lambdatest/<BrandName />-accessibility-cypress-v9"/>
</Check>

Configure the desired capabilities based on your test requirements. For example:

```yaml reference title="lambdatest-config.json"
https://github.com/LambdaTest/lambdatest-accessibility-cypress-v9/blob/main/lambdatest-config.json
```

### Step 2: Establish User Authentication

Now, you need to export your environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [<BrandName /> Profile page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).

Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
<div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
  ```bash
  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
  ```
</div>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows" default>
  <div className="lambdatest__codeblock">
    ```powershell
    {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}"
    set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}"`}
    ```
  </div>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Update the Necessary Capabilities and Configurations in your project

#### 1. Install the Cypress CLI

- If you are passing npm dependencies through **package.json**, then add the below mentioned line there:

```javascript title="package.json"
// ...
"devDependencies": {
  "@cypress/eslint-plugin-dev": "5.0.0",
  // highlight-next-line
  "lambdatest-cypress-cli": "^3.0.30"
},
```

- If you are using **<BrandName />-config.json** to pass the dependency, then pass the given line there:

```javascript title="lambdatest-config.json"
"run_settings": {
  //...
  "npm_dependencies": {
     "cypress": "10.0.0",
     "lambdatest-cypress-cli": "^3.0.30"
  },
  //...
}
```

- if you are not passing npm dependency in **<BrandName />-config.json** you can run

```bash
npm i lambdatest-cypress-cli
```

#### 2. In the `support/index.js` file

Add this import statement in your `index.js` file to import the acceessibility scanner dependency

```javascript
import "lambdatest-cypress-cli/accessibility/support";
```

#### 3. In the `cypress/plugins/index.js` file

Add this template in your `index.js` file.

```javascript title="index.js"
const lambdatestAccessibility = require('lambdatest-cypress-cli/accessibility/plugin');

module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // `on` is used to hook into various events Cypress emits
  // `config` is the resolved Cypress config

  lambdatestAccessibility(on, config);
  return config;
}

```

#### 4. Add the capabilities in the `lambdatest-config.json` file

To enable the accessibility testing within your automated test suite, set the `accessibility: true` in your configuration file. You can also define other settings capabilities as described below.

```javascript title="lambdatest-config.json"
"accessibility" : true,                 // Enable accessibility testing
"accessibility.wcagVersion": "wcag21a", // Specify WCAG version (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level A)
"accessibility.bestPractice": false,    // Exclude best practice issues from results
"accessibility.needsReview": true       // Include issues that need review
```

### Step 4: Execute and Monitor your Test

Now execute your tests and visit the [Automation Dashboard](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/dashboard). Click on the Accessibility tab and check the report generated.
