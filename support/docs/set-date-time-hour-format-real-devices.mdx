Testing applications often requires validation across different date, time, and format scenarios. <BrandName /> now supports dynamic configuration of **date, time, 12/24-hour format**, and **automatic time toggle** on real iOS and Android devices — both in **manual** sessions and via **Appium automation hooks**.

This enables use cases like testing scheduled alerts, AM/PM behaviors, time-bound features, and regional formatting validations.

The modal includes four options to simulate various datetime-related behaviors:

### 1. Set Date and Time Automatically
- **Toggle ON:** Syncs the device with network time.
- **Toggle OFF:** Unlocks manual controls for custom configuration.
- Disabling this is mandatory to manually edit date or time.

### 2. Date
- Opens a calendar picker with selectable dates up to **7 days ahead**.
- Selecting a date updates the system date on the device.
- Past dates and dates beyond 7 days are **grayed out** and unselectable.
- An **Apply** button appears only when a valid date is selected.

### 3. Time
- Allows custom time entry in `HH:MM:SS` format.
- Picker adjusts based on selected hour-format (12 or 24-hour).
- Supports both **manual typing** and **arrow key navigation** for time input.

### 4. Time Format (12/24 Hour)
- Choose between **12-hour** (AM/PM toggle) and **24-hour** formats.
- 12-hour format shows AM/PM option in time picker.
- 24-hour format disables AM/PM selection automatically.
