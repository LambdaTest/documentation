Using the <BrandName /> platform, perform regression testing in just one click and find Visual UI Regression bugs easily with the help of Smart Testing. This documentation will act as your step-by-step guide in performing successful Visual Regression tests.

## Prerequisites for running SmartUI with Cypress

- Basic understanding of Cypress is required.
- Cypress version should be higher than 9.5.0. Click [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog) to know more
- Login to [<BrandName /> SmartUI](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/) with your credentials.
- Copy `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` credentials from `Access Key` button on the top right of the dashboard.

The following steps will guide you in running your first Visual Regression test on <BrandName /> platform -

## Steps to create a SmartUI Project

The first step is to create a project with the application in which we will combine all your builds run on the project. To create a SmartUI Project, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Projects page](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/)
2. Click on the `new project` button
3. Select the platform as <b>Web</b> for executing your `Cypress` tests. 
4. Add name of the project, approvers for the changes found, tags for any filter or easy navigation.
5. Click on the **Submit**.

## Steps to run your first test

---

**Step 1**: Install the required NPM module for `<BrandName /> Cypress CLI` in your project.

```bash
npm install -g testmu ai-cypress-cli
```

**Step 2:** Use `init` command to generate the sample configuration files.

```bash
testmu ai-cypress init
```

**Step 3:** Define SmartUI configuration in the `testmu ai-config.json` file of your Cypress project as shown in the below code snippet.

```json title="/cypress-project/lambdatest ai-config.json"
{
  "lambdatest_auth": {
    "username": "<Your <BrandName /> username>",
    "access_key": "<Your <BrandName /> access key>"
  },
  "browsers": [
    {
      "browser": "Chrome",
      "platform": "Windows 10",
      "versions": ["latest-1"]
    },
    {
      "browser": "Firefox",
      "platform": "Windows 10",
      "versions": ["latest-1"]
    }
  ],
  "run_settings": {
    "cypress_config_file": "cypress.json",
    "build_name": "build-name",
    "parallels": 2,
    "specs": "./cypress/integration/examples/*.spec.js",
    "ignore_files": "",
    "feature_file_suppport": false,
    "network": false,
    "headless": false,
    "reporter_config_file": "",
    "npm_dependencies": {
      "cypress": "9.0.0"
    },
    "smart_ui": {
      // highlight-start
      "project": "<Your Project Name>", // Add your SmartUI Project Name here
      "build": "<Your_Build_Name>", // Please add your build name of choice here
      "baseline": false,// Enable if you want to update to a new baseline build
      // highlight-end
    }
  },
  "tunnel_settings": {
    "tunnel": false,
    "tunnel_name": null
  }
}
```

**Step 4:** Add **cy.screenshot()** method in your test script to capture the screenshots with the desired screenshot name.

```js
describe("Cypress test with Visual Regression", () => {
  it("Example test", () => {
    cy.visit("https://demo.lambdatest.com/");
    // highlight-next-line
    cy.screenshot("<Screenshot Name>"); //Add desired Cypress screenshot name
  });
});
```

**Step 5:** Run the test on the <BrandName /> platform by executing the below-run command:

```bash
testmu ai-cypress run
```

**Step 6:** You can now see the SmartUI dashboard to view the results.

## Advanced Options for Screenshot Comparison

  **Build Configuration** - If you have multiple screenshots running the same test suite and want to run the comparison for the same test suite, want to add a build as a baseline from your test suite or need to access more SmartUI Build Config Options, click [here](/support/docs/smart-ui-build-options/).
  

  **Advanced Test Settings** - We offer multiple options for comparing the **Baseline** and the **Test Output** screenshots captured during your automation testing suites. To know more about our advanced P2P comparison options, click [here](/support/docs/test-settings-options/).
  

  **HTML DOM Config and Options** - In case if you have any dynamic elements that are not in the same position across test runs, you can ignore or select a specific area to be removed from the comparison. For accessing such HTML DOM Config and Options, click [here](/support/docs/html-dom-smartui-options/).
