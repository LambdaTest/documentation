## Validate your HyperExecute YAML with ease !!
The [`--validate`](/support/docs/hyperexecute-cli-run-tests-on-hyperexecute-grid/#--validate) flag checks the syntax and structure of your YAML file without executing any tests, allowing you to quickly verify if the file is properly formatted.

## How It Works
When you pass the `--validate` flag along with your YAML file, the CLI will:
- Validate the structure and syntax of the YAML file.
- Return a success or error message indicating whether the file is correct or if there are issues that need attention.

```
./hyperexecute --user YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME --key YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE  --validate
```
