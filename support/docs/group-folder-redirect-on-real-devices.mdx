# Group Folder Redirect On Real Devices  

<BrandName /> supports **Group Folder Redirect** for iOS apps on Real Devices.  
This feature ensures your app uses its **private container directory** instead of the **shared app group container**, which becomes inaccessible after **app resigning** on Real Devices.

---

## Use Cases 

- Ensure your app maintains **file system access** after being re-signed on Real Devices.  
- Prevent issues when your app relies on the **shared App Group container**, which becomes inaccessible after resigning.  
- Guarantee consistent **storage and retrieval of files** by using the app’s private container.
