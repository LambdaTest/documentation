# Bamboo CI Integration with HyperExecute
* * *

Bamboo is a continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) server from Atlassian. It helps teams automate the software development and delivery process, from code commit to production deployment. Bamboo can be used to build, test, and deploy software on a variety of platforms, including cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments.

This document will show you how to integrate Bamboo CI Pipeline with HyperExecute to greatly shorten your test cycles.

## How To Integrate Bamboo CI Pipeline with Hyperexecute
***

To integrate CircleCI Pipeline with HyperExecute, follow the below steps:

### Pre-requisite:

You can refer to different supported versions from [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/supported-platforms-289276764.html) as per your requirements.

Below are the mentioned softwares used for this documentation:

- Java 11
- **DataBase** - PostgreSQL 14.9
- **Operating System** - Linux Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

### Step 1: Setup Bamboo CI in your local device

1. [Download](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/download) the Bamboo CI in your device.

2. Extract the file in your desired location. Let's say it as **ROOT_FOLDER**

3. Before you run Bamboo for the first time, specify your Bamboo Home Directory, where your Bamboo data is stored.
    - Create your Bamboo Home Directory (without spaces in the name).

    > **NOTE:** You should not create your Bamboo Home Directory inside the **ROOT_FOLDER**. They should be entirely separate locations. If you do put the Home Directory in the **ROOT_FOLDER**, it will be overwritten and lost when Bamboo is upgraded.

    - Go to the following file location

    ```bash
    ROOT_FOLDER/atlassian-bamboo/WEB-INF/classes/bamboo-init.properties
    ``` 
    - You have to uncomment the **bamboo.home** line and provide the absolute path to your Home Directory.

### Step 2: Start the Bamboo Server

- Change to the **ROOT_FOLDER** from the command-line and start the server

```bash
cd ROOT_FOLDER

./bin/start-bamboo.sh
```

- Now type ``http://localhost:8085/`` in your browser to open the Bamboo GUI.

> **NOTE:** If you are running Bamboo for the very first time, then you need to configure the Setup Wizard as well. Follow the instructions [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/running-the-setup-wizard-289276851.html) to configure it.

### Step 3: Create a Project and a Plan

- Click on **Create Project** button.
