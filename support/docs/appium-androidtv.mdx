## Tutorial To Run Your First Test On LambdaTest
As smart TVs continue to grow in popularity, relying solely on manual testing is no longer sufficient. Automating Android TV testing provides broader device coverage, enhances user experience by validating remote-based navigation and voice commands, and eliminates repetitive manual tasks. It also helps uncover issues earlier in the development cycle, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience across different Android TV models. 
In this guide, you will learn how to set up and run your **Android TV** automation testing scripts with **Appium** on the **LambdaTest Real Device Cloud platform**.

## Objective
By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1.  Set up an environment for testing your Apps using **Android TV** with **Appium**.
2.  Understand and configure the core capabilities required for your Appium test suite.
3.  Explore the advanced features of LambdaTest.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you would need to follow these steps:

- You have access to LambdaTest username and accessKey. If you have not registered yet, you can do the same by visiting our [website](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register). You will be able to access the credentials in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile)
- Install the latest Python build from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend using the latest version.
- Make sure **pip** is installed in your system. You can install **pip** from [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## Supported Models

| Device Model          | Platform Version |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Nvidia Shield TV      | Android 11       |

## Run Your First Test
### 1. Upload your application
Upload your **Android TV** application (.ipa file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File from System:**

```bash
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@/Users/macuser/Downloads/android-tv-sample-app.apk" -F "name=androidtv_app" -F "type=androidtv"
```


### 2. Set Up Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/). Then, set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables with following commands.

  <Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
```bash
export LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
```powershell
set LT_USERNAME=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Configure Desired Capabilities

In your automation script, set up the **platform capability** to specify that you are testing on an Android TV device.

```python highlight={4}
desired_caps = {
    "deviceName" : "Nvidia Shield TV",
    "platformVersion" :  "11",
    "platform" : "androidtv",
    "isRealMobile":True,
    "build": "Android TV Testing",
    "app":"APP_URL",     # Enter app url here
    "network": False,
    "geoLocation": "FR",
    "devicelog": True,
    "privateCloud": True, # For private cloud testing
    "visual" : True,
    "autoGrantPermissions": True
}
```
