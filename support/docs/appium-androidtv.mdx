## Tutorial To Run Your First Test On <BrandName />
---
As smart TVs continue to grow in popularity, relying solely on manual testing is no longer sufficient. Automating Android TV testing provides broader device coverage, enhances user experience by validating remote-based navigation and voice commands, and eliminates repetitive manual tasks. It also helps uncover issues earlier in the development cycle, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience across different Android TV models. 
In this guide, you will learn how to set up and run your **Android TV** automation testing scripts with **Appium** on the **<BrandName /> Real Device Cloud platform**.

> Android TV support is available only with Private Device Plan.

## Run Your First Test
---

### 1. Set Up Authentication

Make sure you have your <BrandName /> credentials with you to run test automation scripts on <BrandName />. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/). Then, set <BrandName /> `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables with following commands.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
  ```bash

  {`export LT_USERNAME=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">

  ```powershell

  {`set LT_USERNAME=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} \`
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Upload your application
Upload your **Android TV** application (.ipa file) to the <BrandName /> servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

 **Using App File from System:**
 ```bash

{`curl -u "$LT_USERNAME:$LT_ACCESS_KEY" \
-X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" \
-F "appFile=@smarttube_stable.apk" \
-F "name=androidtv_app" \
-F "type=androidtv"
`}

```

</p>

### 3. Configure Desired Capabilities

In your automation script, set up the **platform capability** to specify that you are testing on an Android TV device.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Java">

```java
  DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
  HashMap<String, Object> ltOptions = new HashMap<String, Object>();

  ltOptions.put("build", "Android TV Demo");
  ltOptions.put("name", "Android TV Demo");
  ltOptions.put("deviceName", "Nvidia Shield TV");
  ltOptions.put("platformVersion", "11");
  ltOptions.put("platformName", "androidtv");
  ltOptions.put("isRealMobile", true);  
  ltOptions.put("privateCloud", true);
  ltOptions.put("w3c", true);
  ltOptions.put("automationName", "UiAutomator2");
  ltOptions.put("app", "lt://APP_ID");  
  /* Optional Capability */
  /* ltOptions.put("appPackage", "org.smarttube.stable"); */

  capabilities.setCapability("LT:Options", ltOptions);
```

</Tab>
