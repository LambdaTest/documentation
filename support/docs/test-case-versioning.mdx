Test Case Versioning allows teams to track every change made to a test case over time. It provides a complete audit trail, ensures traceability, supports rollbacks to earlier versions, and makes collaboration across teams more reliable.

## Creating Versions
Every edit to a test case whether it’s updating steps, descriptions, or fields creates a new version once saved. Here’s how the save test case flow works:

- After making changes to a test case, the `Save Changes` button in the top right corner will be enabled.
 
- When saving, you can add a commit message to help identify the change in the audit history.
 
- In the `Version History` tab, you can view all commits made to that test case.

### Version Comparison
To see the change log and compare different versions of a test case, click the `Compare` button in the **Version History** tab.

### View Older Versions
To view the details of a test case at a specific version, open the desired commit and switch to **View Mode**. This shows the state of the test case at that point in time.

### Revert to a Version
When you revert a test case to a specific version, a new version is created that copies the contents of the selected version.
