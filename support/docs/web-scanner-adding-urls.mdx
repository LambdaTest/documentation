## Step 3: Add URLs to Your Scan

After configuring the scan type (Step 2), the **Add URLs** section (Step 3) allows you to populate the test targets. You can choose from one of the following input methods.

### 1. Add URLs Manually

Use this method when you want full control over each scanned URL or you’re testing only a handful of critical paths.

**Instructions:**
* Paste each URL in a new line or input box.
* Ensure proper formatting (`https://` required).

**Best for:**
* Login pages, checkout flows, admin pages.

### 2. Import via CSV File

Use this method when you already maintain URL lists in a spreadsheet or text file.

**CSV Format:**
One URL per line (no header).
```csv
[https://example.com](https://example.com)
[https://example.com/pricing](https://example.com/pricing)
[https://example.com/contact](https://example.com/contact)
```

**Instructions**:

* Click on Import CSV.

* Upload your .csv file.

* URLs will auto-populate the scan list.

Ideal for:

* Large teams with pre-approved page lists.

* Reusing URL sets across projects.

### 3. Import via Sitemap
Use this method when:
* you want to extract URLs from an existing sitemap
* you’re scanning a dynamic, live website.

**Instructions**:
* Paste the sitemap URL (XML format).
* Click Fetch Sitemap.
* The scanner will auto-detect URLs.
* You can selectively check/uncheck desired pages.

Ideal for:
* Scanning large public websites.
* Ensuring complete coverage.

### URL Limits and Validations
**Max URL Limit**: would depend upon your SmartUI (*for visual scan*) and Accessibility (*for accessibility scan*) plan.

**All URLs must be valid and working.**

**Duplicate URLs will be auto-filtered**

**Reusability Tips**
* For frequently used URL sets, save them in CSVs and upload as needed.
* Create and save CSV url lists from sitemap and use in CSV mode for future.
