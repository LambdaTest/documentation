Robot Framework is a generic, open-source automation framework designed for acceptance testing, acceptance test-driven development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It is widely used in software testing due to its simplicity, extensibility, and ease of use. The framework is keyword-driven, meaning that tests are written using predefined keywords, making it accessible even to non-programmers.

<Note>
Ensure your project is configured with the Robot framework and all test scripts are in place.
