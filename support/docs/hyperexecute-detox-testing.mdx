Detox is a popular end-to-end testing framework for React Native applications. This documentation will help you run your Detox tests on <BrandName /> HyperExecute using your local system setup.

## Run a Sample Project
### Step 1: Clone Sample Repository

<Check>
**SAMPLE REPO**

Download or Clone the Detox sample from <BrandName />'s GitHub Repository
<GitHubButton url="https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-detox" />
</Check>

### Step 2: Download the CLI in your Project
Download the HyperExecute CLI and copy it into the root folder of the downloaded sample repository.

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| macOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |

### Step 3: Execute your Test Suite
From the project root directory, execute the below CLI command in your terminal:

```bash
./hyperexecute --user YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME --key YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

<Note>
**NOTE:** In case of macOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General tab**.

You've successfully triggered the Detox tests on HyperExecute. Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status. 

## Configure your own Project

### Step 1: Download the CLI in your Project
Download the HyperExecute CLI and copy it into the root folder.

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| macOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |

### Step 2: Configure YAML in your Test Suite
Use the sample YAML below to configure your execution:

```yaml hyperexecute.yaml
autosplit: true

# Set the concurrency level for test execution (2 devices in parallel)
concurrency: 1

framework:
    # Name of the test framework (raw in this case)
    name: raw
    args:
        buildName: LT-Detox-Sample
        deviceLogs: true
        devices: 
            - .*-.*
        disableReleaseDevice: true
        env:
            DETOX: true #detox
        isRealMobile: true
        mobileDC: true
        platformName: android
        # privateCloud: true # use this for private cloud
        queueTimeout: 600

        # Enable or disable video recording support
        video: true

# Make test status as HyperExecute job's status
frameworkStatusOnly: true

# job label for hyperexecute job
jobLabel: ['raw','detox']

# Pre-install required dependencies from pre-setup scripts
pre:
    - bash ./lambdatest/scripts/pre-setup.sh

# Specify the target platform for test execution (Android in this case)
runson: android

# Test discovery configuration
testDiscovery:
    # Command to discover tests from the discovery.txt file
    command: cat ./lambdatest/discovery.txt 
    # Test discovery mode is static
    mode: static 
    # Test type is raw (custom test implementation)
    type: raw

# Command to run the tests using the testRunnerCommand
testRunnerCommand: npm run $test

# Define the version of the configuration file
version: "0.2"
```

<Note>

📘 To explore more configuration options and tailor settings to your project needs, check out the [YAML documentation](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-parameters/).

### Step 3: Monitor the Test Execution

Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status. 

<img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/hyperexecute/frameworks/Detox/Detox_dashboard.png" alt="TestNG HyperExecute Terminal Logs" width="1920" height="868"/>

You can click on **View Test** from the **HyperExecute logs**, which will take you to the [App Automation dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build). There, you can access detailed **device logs**, **crash logs**, and **Metadata** for your test. You’ll also be able to watch a **video recording** of the Test sessions for better **debugging** and **analysis**.
