## Introduction
---
Basic Authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request. In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where credentials is the **Base64** encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon `:`.

To provide support for Basic Authentication in Safari during Web Automation, we have introduced a new lambda hook in our `iOS` Real Device (RD) web sessions.

<Info>
1. This hook is not compatible with any app-based sessions.
2. The capability `autoAcceptAlerts` must be set to `false`.
</Info>

## How to Use
---
Here is an example of how to use the Basic Authentication hook in Python:

```python
data = {
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "admin",
  "url": "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth",
}
driver.execute_script("lambda-ios-set-basic-auth", data)
```

<Info>
**It is important to note that all three parameters (username, password, URL) are mandatory and must be passed to the script.**

</Info>

## Limitations
---
Please note, this hook is designed to be used exclusively with Safari on iOS Real Device (RD) web sessions and is not compatible with Android sessions or any app-based sessions.
