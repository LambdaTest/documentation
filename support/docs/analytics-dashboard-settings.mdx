### Email Notifications

Keep your team informed about dashboard activity and test results by configuring email notifications.

- **Enable/Disable Notifications:** Use the toggle to activate or deactivate email notifications for the dashboard. When disabled, no email updates will be sent.
- **Frequency:** Choose how often you want to receive email updates from the dropdown. Options include **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**.
- **Time & Period:** Set a specific delivery time for your scheduled reports. Select the hour from the **Time** dropdown (e.g., `9:00`) and choose **AM** or **PM** from the **Period** dropdown.
- **Date Range:** Select **Default** to use the platform's default date range, or select **Custom** and specify a number of days. For example, setting a custom range to `7` includes data from the last 7 days in each email.
- **Emails:** Enter one or more email addresses to receive notifications. Click **+ Add** after each address to include multiple recipients. This is useful for keeping stakeholders, QA leads, or team members in the loop.
- **Update:** After configuring your preferences, click **Update** to save changes. Your notification settings will take effect immediately.

<Tip>
**Tip:** Use custom date ranges and recipient lists to tailor notifications for different teams or reporting needs.

Integrate your dashboard with Slack to receive instant updates and foster real-time collaboration.

- **Enable/Disable Notifications:** Toggle Slack notifications on or off as needed. When enabled, updates will be sent directly to your selected Slack channel.

- **Date Range:** Choose the default or set a custom range (number of days) to define the scope of data included in each notification.

### MS Teams Notification Settings

Integrate your dashboard with Microsoft Teams to receive timely updates and enhance team collaboration.

- **Enable/Disable Notifications:** Toggle MS Teams notifications on or off as needed. When enabled, updates will be sent directly to your selected Teams channel.
- **Notification Frequency:** Set how often notifications are sent to MS Teams (e.g., Daily, Weekly). This helps ensure your team stays informed without overwhelming them with messages.
- **Date Range:** Choose the default or set a custom range (number of days) to define the scope of data included in each notification.
- **View Selection:** Select the specific dashboard view or analytics channel for which notifications should be sent. This allows you to target relevant information to the right Teams channels or groups.
- **Update & Save Preferences:** Click **Update** to apply your MS Teams notification settings.

### Share Link Settings

Easily share your dashboard with colleagues, clients, or external stakeholders while maintaining control over access and privacy.

- **Link Expiration:** Set the share link to expire after 7, 15, or 30 days, or select **Never** for a permanent link. Expiring links are recommended for temporary collaborations or reviews.
- **Privacy Controls:**
  - **Make Dashboard Private:** Restrict access so only you can view the dashboard. Use this for sensitive or in-progress dashboards.
  - **Allow Anyone with the Link:** Enable open access for anyone who has the link, ideal for broad sharing within your organization.
  - **Set a Custom Password:** Add an extra layer of security by requiring users to enter a password to access the dashboard. This is especially useful when sharing with external users or when the link has no expiry.

<Note>
**Password setup is mandatory if you select "Never" for link expiry. Exporting the dashboard will be disabled in this case to protect sensitive data.**

</Note>

- **Export Restrictions:** If you set the link to never expire and require a password, dashboard export functionality will be disabled to enhance security.

<Tip>
**Security Tip:** Always use password protection and link expiration when sharing dashboards outside your core team.
</Tip>

### Edit Dashboard Name

1. Enter a new name in the **Dashboard Name** field at the top of the settings panel. Use descriptive names that reflect the dashboard's purpose (e.g., "SMOKE Dashboard for Prod Playwright").
2. Click **Save** to apply the new name. The updated name will be visible to all users with access to the dashboard.

<Tip>
**Tip:** Use naming conventions to organize dashboards by project, environment, or team.
</Tip>

1. Scroll to the bottom of the settings panel.
2. Click the **Delete** button next to "Delete this Dashboard".
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

<Warning>
**This action is irreversible. Once deleted, the dashboard and all its data cannot be recovered. Ensure you have exported or backed up any important information before proceeding.**

</Warning>

<Warning>
**Recommendation:** Only delete dashboards when you are certain they are no longer required by any team members.
