### Share Link Settings

Easily share your dashboard with colleagues, clients, or external stakeholders while maintaining control over access and privacy.

- **Link Expiration:** Set the share link to expire after 7, 15, or 30 days, or select **Never** for a permanent link. Expiring links are recommended for temporary collaborations or reviews.
- **Privacy Controls:**
  - **Make Dashboard Private:** Restrict access so only you can view the dashboard. Use this for sensitive or in-progress dashboards.
  - **Allow Anyone with the Link:** Enable open access for anyone who has the link, ideal for broad sharing within your organization.
  - **Set a Custom Password:** Add an extra layer of security by requiring users to enter a password to access the dashboard. This is especially useful when sharing with external users or when the link has no expiry.

<Info>
**NOTE**

Password setup is mandatory if you select "Never" for link expiry. Exporting the dashboard will be disabled in this case to protect sensitive data.
</Info>

- **Export Restrictions:** If you set the link to never expire and require a password, dashboard export functionality will be disabled to enhance security.

<Warning>
**SECURITY TIP**

Always use password protection and link expiration when sharing dashboards outside your core team.
</Warning>
