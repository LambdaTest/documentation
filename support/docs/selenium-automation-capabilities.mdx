Desired Capabilities in Selenium test scripts, encoded as key-value pairs, allow you, as a tester or a developer, to define specific test environment requirements. These requirements encompass operating systems, browser combinations, versions, and other parameters supported by <BrandName />'s Cloud Grid to run your desired [automation framework tests](/support/docs/getting-started-with-lambdatest-automation#supported-languages-and-frameworks).

**TIP**

You can also use <BrandName />'s [Automation Capabilities Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/) to autogenerate your required capabilities class to run Selenium and Appium automation test scripts on the <BrandName /> [Selenium Grid](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/why-selenium-grid-is-ideal-for-automated-browser-testing/).

You can generate the capabilities in all of the six programming languages i.e. Java, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, and Python.

<Note>
The values provided for any capability are both **space-insensitive** and **case-insensitive**. This means that any value you provide as **Mac OS X 10.13** or **mac os x 10.13** would be correct.
