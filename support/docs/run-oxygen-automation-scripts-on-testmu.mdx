Oxygen is an open-source test automation framework offering a low code approach for Selenium and Appium tests. The scripts are based on JavaScript and look almost as plain as English, making them intuitive.

Oxygen supports <BrandName /> Selenium Grid, meaning you can configure your <BrandName /> account on your Oxygen instance to perform cross browser testing on 3000+ real browser running on real operating systems, on-cloud. That way, you can eliminate the need for configuring in-house Selenium Grid infrastructure and run your Oxygen IDE test over a wider test coverage.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure to [download the Oxygen framework](https://docs.oxygenhq.org/download-installation-start/download-and-installation/download-oxygen-ide) for your operating system.
- Retrieve your <BrandName /> authentication credentials i.e., your <BrandName /> Username, Access Key and Hub URL. You can do so by visiting the [<BrandName /> automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/) and clicking on the key icon near the help button.

**Step 3:** Once you turn the toggle on, you need to fill the mandatory fields to run your Oxygen tests on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. These mandatory fields include your Hub URL, your <BrandName /> Username, and your <BrandName /> Access Token.

You can also Capture Browser Console, Capture Network Logs, Take Screenshots, and do Video Recording for your Oxygen test execution over <BrandName /> Selenium Grid by enabling the checkboxes. After selecting the preferred checkboxes and filling the mandatory fields, click on **Save & Close**.

**Step 4:** You will now find a drop-down beside the **Run** button, which says Local, indicating that the tests are being executed on your local machine. To run the tests on the <BrandName /> cloud, you would need to select the value for <BrandName />.

Kudos! That is all you need to do for integrating your Oxygen framework with <BrandName /> Selenium Grid. Now, as you run the test, it would be executed over the Selenium Grid offered by <BrandName />, which would enable you to ensure a sturdy cross browser compatible web-application.
