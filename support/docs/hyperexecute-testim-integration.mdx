Testim is a AI Native test authoring platform designed to automate software testing, particularly web and mobile applications. It focuses on creating stable and reliable automated tests. It allows creating tests without writing code or by incorporating custom JavaScript for more intricate scenarios. You can manage and scale the test automation process efficiently, which is particularly valuable for Agile development teams.

This document details the seamless integration between HyperExecute and Testim, enabling you to run your automated tests.

## Prerequisite

- You will need your Testim account.
- <BrandName /> account. You can [sign up for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/dashboard).
- <BrandName /> [Username and Access Key](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-get-my-username-and-access-key/)

## Step 1: Setup the Grid

- Click on your profile icon >> **Grids** button.
- Click on **Add New Grid** button >> select **<BrandName />** as your Grid Type and click on **Next** button.
- Configure your Grid:

## Step 3: Configure your Test to execute from CLI

- Go to the **Settings** >> select the **CLI** tab.
- You will find the sample command >> copy that and paste it in the `testRunnerCommand` in your YAML file.

## Step 4: Configure your YAML

Create an empty folder, inside which create your YAML file to trigger the test.

- In the `pre` flag, enter the command to download the testim cli.
- In the `testRunnerCommand`, enter your runner command copied in the previous step.

```yaml
---
version: 0.1
globalTimeout: 150
testSuiteTimeout: 150
testSuiteStep: 150

runson: mac

pre: 
  - npm i -g @testim/testim-cli

runtime:
  language: node
  version: "18.0.0"

autosplit: true

concurrency: 1

testDiscovery:

 command: echo "HYP with Testim"

testRunnerCommand: ./.hyperexecute/snooper --frameWork testim --testimProject YOUR_PROJECT_ID --testimToken YOUR_TESTIM_TOKEN --testimProjectBranch YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
```

## Step 5: Setup the CLI

After configuring your YAML file, you need to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

### Download the HyperExecute CLI

The CLI is used for triggering the tests on HyperExecute. It is recommend to download the CLI binary on the host system and keep it in the root directory of the suite to perform the tests on HyperExecute.

You can download the CLI for your desired platform from the below mentioned links:

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| MacOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |

### Setup Environment Variable

Now, you need to export your environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [<BrandName /> Profile page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).

Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
```bash
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
```powershell
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 6: Execute your Test

<Note>
**NOTE:** In case of MacOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General tab**.
</Note>

Run the below command in your terminal at the root folder of the project:

```bash
./hyperexecute --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

OR use this command if you have not exported your username and access key in the step 2.

```bash
./hyperexecute --user YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME --key YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```
