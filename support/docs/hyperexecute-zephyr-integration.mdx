Zephyr Scale is a test management platform that helps you plan, manage, and measure your tests inside Jira. It's designed from the ground up to support large test libraries and scaling teams

This document details the seamless integration between HyperExecute and qTest, enabling you to run your automated tests on a variety of devices and real devices provided by <BrandName />.

## Prerequisites

- Install the [Zephyr Scale - Test Management](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1213259/zephyr-scale-test-management-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) for Jira application from the Atlassian Marketplace.
- <BrandName /> account. You can [sign up for free](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/dashboard).
- <BrandName /> [Username and Access Key](/support/docs/hyperexecute-how-to-get-my-username-and-access-key/)
- A Jira Project key.
- A Zephyr Scale Access token. You can get this from the `profiles and settings` option of your Jira Board.

## Step 1: Setup Your Test Suite

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Tip>
**Sample repo**

Download or Clone the code sample for the Maestro framework from the <BrandName /> GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

<a href="https://github.com/amanchopra1905/hyp-zephyr-scale-integration" className="github__anchor"><img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/icons/github.png' alt="Image" /> View on GitHub</a>

</Tip>

## Step 2: Setup the CLI in your Test Suite

After cloning / downloading the sample repo, you need to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

### Download the HyperExecute CLI

The CLI is used for triggering the tests on HyperExecute. It is recommend to download the CLI binary on the host system and keep it in the root directory of the suite to perform the tests on HyperExecute.

You can download the CLI for your desired platform from the below mentioned links:

| Platform | HyperExecute CLI |
| ---------| ---------------- |
| Windows | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe |
| MacOS | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute |
| Linux | https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute |

### Setup Environment Variable

Now, you need to export your environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [<BrandName /> Profile page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile).

Run the below mentioned commands in your terminal to setup the CLI and the environment variables.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<Tab title="Linux / MacOS">

  ```bash

  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
  
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">

  ```powershell

  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
  
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Configure the Test Script

In the `PostTestResults.java` script, add the following String parameters.

* File name of your test results.
* File path of the test result file.
* Jira Project key.
* Zephyr Scale Access token.

```js 
public class PostTestResults {

    public void callApi() {

        String fileName = "TEST-com.testmu ai.JUnitTodo.xml" ; //provide the file name of the test results
        String filePath = "target/surefire-reports/TEST-com.testmu ai.JUnitTodo.xml"; //provide the file path of the test result file
        String projectKey = "ZD"; //provide the Jira project key 
        String token = "abcdefghijklmnop123456"; // provide Zephyr Scale access token
```

## Step 4: Configure YAML in your Test Suite

```yaml
---
version: 0.1
globalTimeout: 150
testSuiteTimeout: 150
testSuiteStep: 150

runson: linux

autosplit: true
retryOnFailure: true

maxRetries: 1
concurrency: 3

env:
  # PAT: ${{ .secrets.testKey }}
  CACHE_DIR: m2_cache_dir
  TARGET_OS: linux

cacheKey: '{{ checksum "pom.xml" }}'
cacheDirectories:
  - ${CACHE_DIR}

shell: bash

pre:
  # Download and install packages in the CACHE_DIR.
  # Skip execution of the tests in the pre step
  - mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=${CACHE_DIR} -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install

post:
  - cat hyperexecute-zephyr-scale.yaml

testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: dynamic
  command: grep 'public class' src/test/java/com/testmu ai/*.java | awk '{print$3}'

testRunnerCommand: mvn -Dplatname=linux -Dmaven.repo.local=m2_cache_dir -Dtest=$test -P single
# test site
jobLabel: ['hyperexecute', 'zephyr']
```

## Step 5: Execute your Test Suite

<Warning>
**NOTE :** In case of MacOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General tab**.
</Warning>


Run the below command in your terminal at the root folder of the project:

```bash
./hyperexecute --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

OR use this command if you have not exported your username and access key in the step 2.

```bash

    ./hyperexecute --user YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME --key YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY --config RELATIVE_PATH_OF_YOUR_YAML_FILE 
  
```

## Step 6: Monitor the Test Execution

Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status.
