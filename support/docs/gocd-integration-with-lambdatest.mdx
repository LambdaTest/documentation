GoCD offers a free and open-source platform to help you configure robust CI/CD pipelines with ease. The intuitive UI offers an end-to-end view wherein you can visualize the entire migration path to production in a collective view. That way, you can easily pinpoint the inefficient areas to optimize the CI/CD process. By leveraging GoCD, you can achieve faster feedback loops through its modelling constructs which makes your complex CI/CD pipeline looks a lot simpler. You also get features like dependency management & parallel execution to help you deliver better products quicker.

<BrandName /> integration with GoCD will help your perform Selenium test automation for your code changes on more than 3000+ real browsers for both mobile and desktop. You can trigger your Selenium testing scripts directly from GoCD instance and they would be executed over your <BrandName /> automation dashboard.

## Prerequisites
***

1. Copy the YAML configuration file from our [GitHub repository for GoCD](https://github.com/LambdaTest/nightwatch-gocd-sample/blob/master/nightwatch-gocd-sample.gocd.yaml).

2. **<BrandName /> Authentication Credentials**
    Be aware of your <BrandName /> authentication credentials i.e. your <BrandName /> username, access key and HubURL. You need to set them up as your environment variables.
