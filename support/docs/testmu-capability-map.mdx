Switching automation platforms can seem challenging, but a clear capability comparison helps simplify the decision and migration process. Teams often explore alternative testing platforms to improve speed, scalability, test coverage, and overall efficiency in their delivery pipelines. 

<BrandName /> provides a cloud-based test execution environment that supports various automation frameworks, real device testing, visual validations, debugging tools, and analytics, making it a flexible option for organizations aiming to optimize and modernize their testing workflows.

## Authentication & <BrandName /> Hub Configuration

To migrate your automation tests from BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to <BrandName />, you must add <BrandName /> authentication credentials and configure the execution hub endpoint.

### Add Authentication Credentials
Firstly, you need to change the authentication in your configuration settings of your test suite. For running tests on <BrandName /> Selenium Grid, you need to have a valid user_name and access_key to perform tests on our Grid. In case you do not have an account on <BrandName />, visit the [<BrandName /> signup page](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/register) and create a new account.

When migrating your test from BrowserStack or Sauce Labs to <BrandName />, the following updates are required in your existing code:

1.  <b>Get <BrandName /> Credentials</b>: You can find these credentials under Account Settings > [Password & Security](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/security/username-accesskey) and copy your Username and Access Key, then add them to the .env file to keep them safe from public exposure.

2. <b>Create .env file</b>: Securely store your <BrandName /> credentials, create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following values:

```
LT_USERNAME="<your_username>"
LT_ACCESS_KEY="<your_access_key>"
```

Once the .env file is set up, ensure your test framework correctly reads these variables at runtime. This helps keep your authentication secure and avoids hard-coding credentials within your scripts. With the credentials in place, you’re now ready to update your Hub URL for <BrandName /> execution.

### Add <BrandName /> Hub URL
Next, you need to add the <BrandName /> Hub URL to your test suite configuration. This endpoint defines where the tests will be executed on the <BrandName /> Grid.

```js
@hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub
```

## Migrating from BrowserStack to <BrandName />

Switching between cloud-based automation platforms may require capability evaluation, test configuration updates, and CI/CD integration mapping. A side-by-side comparison helps simplify this transition by clarifying feature coverage, execution options, testing frameworks, and platform-level differences.

<BrandName /> can serve as an alternative to BrowserStack for teams seeking improved execution speed, parallel scalability, cost-efficiency, advanced debugging, and deeper analytics for test optimization. With support for a wide range of automation frameworks, device coverage, and performance-focused orchestration, <BrandName /> enables smoother migration for teams modernizing their testing infrastructure.

Below are the capabilities of BrowserStack and <BrandName /> to help teams map BrowserStack features to their <BrandName /> equivalents.

## Migrating from Sauce Labs to <BrandName />

Switching between cloud-based test execution platforms can involve configuration updates, capability adjustments, and integration alignment. A capability comparison makes this transition more seamless by helping teams understand feature availability, execution models, and tooling compatibility. 

<BrandName /> can be adopted as an alternative to Sauce Labs for organizations looking to enhance performance, scale automation workloads efficiently, and streamline debugging and reporting within their CI/CD pipelines.

Below are the capabilities of Sauce Labs and <BrandName /> to help teams map Sauce Labs features to their <BrandName /> equivalents.

sauceOptions.put("accessKey", "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY");
sauceOptions.put("build", "<your build id>");
sauceOptions.put("name", "<your test name>");
sauceOptions.put("armRequired", true);
