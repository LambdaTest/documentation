---
## Run your first test

### 1. Upload your application
Upload your **Roku TV** application (.zip file) to the <BrandName /> servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

 **Using App File from System:**
 ```bash

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/roku-sample-app.zip"" -F "name="roku_app""
`}

```

{/* **Using App URL:**

```bash

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "url=:https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/roku-sample-app.zip" -F "name=roku-sample-app"
`}

``` */}

<Tip>
**- If you do not have any **.zip** file, you can run your sample tests on <BrandName /> by using our sample :link: [RokuTV app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/roku-sample-app.zip).**

- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `APP_URL` of the format - ``lt://APP123456789123456789`` and will be used in the next step.

</Tip>

### 2. Clone the sample project

1. Clone the TestMu AI’s [LT-appium-rokutv](https://github.com/TestMu AI/LT-appium-rokutv) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TestMu AI/LT-appium-rokutv
cd LT-appium-rokutv
```

### 3. Set up your authentication

Make sure you have your TestMu AI credentials with you to run test automation scripts on TestMu AI. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/). Then, set TestMu AI `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables with following commands.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<Tab title="Linux / MacOS">
  ```bash

  {`export LT_USERNAME=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Windows">

  ```powershell

  {`set LT_USERNAME=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()} \`
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}

```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Write your automation script

An automation script for the sample application available above has been provided below. Ensure to update the `APP_URL`, `username` and `accessKey` in the code scripts before running the tests.

**Info:**
Before running the script, please make sure that the file webDriver.py from Step 2, is in the same directory as this file.

```python title="main.py"
from appium import webdriver
import os
import time
from appium.options.android import UiAutomator2Options

def getCaps():
    desired_caps = {
        "automationName": "Roku",
        "deviceName": "Roku Ultra",
        "platformVersion": "11",
        "platformName": "roku",
        "isRealMobile": True,
        "build": "Roku Testing",
        "app": "APP_URL",   # Enter app url here
        "network": False,
        "devicelog": True,
        "privateCloud": True,
        "visual": True,
        "idleTimeout": 1800,
    }
    return desired_caps

def runTest():
    if os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME") is None:
        # Enter LT username below if environment variables have not been added
        username = "<YOUR_LT_USERNAME>"
    else:
        username = os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME")

    if os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY") is None:
        # Enter LT accesskey below if environment variables have not been added
        accesskey = "<YOUR_LT_ACCESS_KEY>"
    else:
        accesskey = os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY")

    # grid url
    gridUrl = "mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub"

    # capabilities
    desired_cap = getCaps()
    url = "https://" + username + ":" + accesskey + "@" + gridUrl

    print("Initiating remote driver:")
    driver = webdriver.Remote(
        options=UiAutomator2Options().load_capabilities(desired_cap),
        command_executor=url
    )

    # run test
    print(driver.session_id)

    # Simulate remote control actions
    driver.execute_script("roku: pressKey", {"key": "Down"})
    driver.execute_script("roku: pressKey", {"key": "Down"})
    time.sleep(1)
    driver.execute_script("roku: pressKey", {"key": "Right"})
    driver.execute_script("roku: pressKey", {"key": "Up"})
    driver.execute_script("roku: deviceInfo")
    time.sleep(1)
    driver.execute_script("roku: getApps")
    driver.execute_script("roku: pressKey", {"key": "Right"})

    driver.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    runTest()
```

### Configure the test capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

**Supported Capabilities:**
Please check at the end of the doc.

**Platform:**
`"roku"`

```python title="main.py"
    caps = {
       "automationName": "Roku",
       "deviceName": "Roku Express",     #We also support "Roku Ultra"
       "platformVersion": "11",
       "isRealMobile": True,
       "platformName": "roku",
       "build": "Roku Sample Test",
       "app": "APP_URL"          #Add app id here
       "visual": True,
       "devicelog": True
   }

```

<Info>
**Note**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **<a href="https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/">Capabilities Generator Tool</a>**.For more details, please refer to our guide on [Desired Capabilities in Appium](/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/).

</Info>

### 5. Execute your test case

1. Install the required packages from the cloned project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the following command in the directory where your project has been saved to execute your build.

```python
python main.py
```

<Tip>
**If you are unable to run the automation script with the above mentioned commands try **'python3'** command except for **'python'**.**

## Supported Commands
We utilise the Appium Roku Driver to run tests on Roku via Appium, here's a list of all the commands the driver supports from the project's [README](https://github.com/headspinio/appium-roku-driver?tab=readme-ov-file#roku-commands):

|Command|Parameters|Description|
|-------|----------|-----------|
|`roku: pressKey`|`key`|Press the remote key whose value matches `key` (must be one of the [supported key values](https://developer.roku.com/en-ca/docs/developer-program/debugging/external-control-api.md#keypress-key-values) from the Roku documentation). As addressed in the documentation, Roku TVs also support additional keys such as `PowerOff` and `PowerOn`. |
|`roku: deviceInfo`||Get information about the Roku device|
|`roku: getApps`||Get a list of apps installed on the device. The response will be a list of objects with the following keys: `id`, `type`, `subtype`, `version`, and `name`.|
|`roku: activeApp`||Get information about the active app, in the same format as `roku: getApps`.|
|`roku: activateApp`|`appId` (required), `contentId`, `mediaType`|Launch an app with the corresponding `appId`. Optionally include `contentId` and `mediaType` information (with the same properties as described above for the `activateApp` command)|
|`roku: selectElement`|`elementId` (required) |Moves the focus on an element having locator XPath as `elementId`. If it is unable to focus on the element, the driver will respond with an error.|
|`roku: playerState`||Get the state of the media player. The data will be returned as a JSON object, corresponding to the information included in the [query/media-player ECP result](https://developer.roku.com/en-ca/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/external-control-api.md#querymedia-player-example)
|`roku: deepLink`|`contentId`, `mediaType`|As described in the [Roku dev docs](https://developer.roku.com/en-ca/docs/developer-program/discovery/implementing-deep-linking.md#using-ecp-commands-for-testing-deep-linking), you can deep link into content in the running application using a content ID and media type. For this command, `contentId` is required, and `mediaType` defaults to `movie` and must be one of the [valid media types](https://developer.roku.com/en-ca/docs/developer-program/discovery/implementing-deep-linking.md#mediatype-behavior). Note that this command acts on the currently-running app. If you want to test deep-linking into an app that is not launched, use `activateApp` instead.|
|`roku: ecpInput`|`params`|This command allows calling the `/input` ECP command directly. An arbitrary set of key/value pairs can be sent in as a JSON object. No url-encoding of the values needs to be done. For example, to represent the parameters in the ECP command `POST /input?acceleration.x=0.0&acceleration.y=0.0&acceleration.z=9.8` from the ECP docs, you would construct a `params` of `{"acceleration.x": "0.0", "acceleration.y": "0.0", "acceleration.z": "9.8"}`|
