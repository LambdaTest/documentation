<BrandName /> allows you to integrate with GitHub using repo-based OAuth to log issues directly to your GitHub repository from the <BrandName /> platform. 

## Integrating Your GitHub Account Using Repo-Based OAuth

1. Log in to your <BrandName /> account. Ensure that you have either admin or user level access to view and install third-party integrations.

2. Navigate to **Integrations** from the left-sidebar under **Settings**.

3. Click on Project Management, then click **Connect** on the GitHub card.

6. Choose the installation location. Instead of granting access to all GitHub repositories, you also have the option to select a specific repository for installing the <BrandName /> App. 

After selecting the installation location, click **Request** to get the approval for the repository authorization.
