# Capturing Full-Page Screenshots Of Your Websites
* * *

[LT Browser](https://www.lambdatest.com/lt-browser/) lets you capture full-page screenshots of your pre-installed mobile devices, desktops, and laptops. Now you can capture your website's long content with the full-page screenshot feature and compare it across multiple devices.

To get started, you need to download the executable file from here.
