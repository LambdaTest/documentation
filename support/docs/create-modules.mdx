Tired of recreating the same test steps for repetitive testing flows? With Modules in <BrandName /> Test Manager you can streamline your workflow by reusing pre-existing test steps across multiple test cases. This powerful feature enables you to encapsulate redundant testing flows into modular, reusable components, saving time and ensuring consistency across your projects.

## 1.1 Module Creation from existing Test Steps

To export test steps as a module, 
- Navigate to the Test Steps page of your desired Test Case. 
- Select the test steps you wish to include in the module and click the `Create a module` button.

<Note>
**Only **sequential** steps can be clubbed to create a module.**

- Clearly define your new module by entering a concise name and a detailed description. This will help you easily identify and understand its purpose later on.

<Tip>
**When you duplicate a module, its steps, description, and linked projects will also be duplicated.**

</Tip>

### Step 2: Create New Module

- Click on the `Create a Module` button. 
- Define your module and outline the steps you want to include.

Don't worry if you don't have all the details now; you can always edit or add them later.

<Note>
**You must provide **Module name** & create at **least one test step** to be able to create a new module.**

</Note>

<Note>
**Keep in mind Modules can't be deleted but only updated after creation.**

</Note>

## 2. Update Module
Modules support duplication, editing and versioning; however, a new version is only triggered when specific fields are edited.
- Add a step by clicking on `Add Step` or update a step through edit icon. 
- Click on `update` on top right to save changes.
<Note>
**Only **Test Step** or **Expected Outcome** updation will create a new version of the module.**

## 3. Module Versions

### Revert to previous Version
- Click on `revert` to revert your module to that version. Reverting to a previous version will create a new version in your module's history, ensuring a clear audit trail of all changes.

### Compare Versions
Compare your version history side-by-side to easily identify differences and track changes between various iterations of your module.

- Click on `Compare` & select the version to compare with. 

You will be redirected to the Version Comparison page where you can track changes:

<Note>
**Project linking is only added for manual tests in test cases. Hence, modules linked to a particular project are only available to be added in a manual test case. However, for KaneAI test cases, all modules in all projects will be available for selection.**
