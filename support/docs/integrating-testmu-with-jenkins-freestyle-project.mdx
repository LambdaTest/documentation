Integrate <BrandName /> Jenkins plugin with your Jenkins Freestyle project for:   
*   Configure your <BrandName /> credentials for your Jenkins jobs.
*   Set up and tear down the Lambda Tunnel binary file to perform automated cross browser testing even on your locally hosted web apps.
*   Embed all the test results such as video logs, network logs, and screenshots of every step performed through <BrandName /> with your Jenkins job results.

<Warning>
Note: Before you proceed, make sure to integrate [<BrandName /> plugin for Jenkins](/support/docs/jenkins-with-testmu/).

>**Note:** It is recommended to check your network connectivity by **pinging <BrandName />**.

**Step 4:** Add a build step to **Execute Shell**.

<Tip>
**Best Practices**

**Build naming**

Define `LT_BUILD_NAME` in your script using  `${BUILD_TAG}`, and reference the same in your test capabilities. This ensures that each <BrandName /> run is correctly mapped to its corresponding Jenkins build.
</Tip>

**Step 6:** Click on **Apply & Save** to set your configurations and then click on **"Build Now"** to execute your test.

## Test On Locally Hosted Web Applications

* * *

While specifying build environments, check the box to **Use Local Tunnel**. You can then specify a Tunnel name if you like, your <BrandName /> Credentials will be automatically fetched.
