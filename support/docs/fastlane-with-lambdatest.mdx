fastlane is a CI/CD tool to automate beta deployments and releases for Android and iOS apps. It is an open-source platform for Android and iOS app deployment. It will take care of all the tasks like testing, generating screenshots, dealing with code signing, and releasing your application. Provides integration support with all the major CI systems. Adding the <BrandName /> fastlane plugin in Fastfile will help you upload the app to the server and run tests on <BrandName /> real devices.

## Prerequisites

To upload an app to <BrandName /> for app testing, you would need the following things :

    LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY"
    ```

## Installing <BrandName /> fastlane Plugin
***

**Step 1:** Add <BrandName /> [fastlane](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-testmu ai) plugin by running.
```
fastlane add_plugin testmu ai
```

**Step 2:** Add the below action in fastfile in desired lane to upload the app to <BrandName />.   
```
upload_to_lambdatest(
    lt_username: ENV["LT_USERNAME"],
    lt_access_key: ENV["LT_ACCESS_KEY"],
    file_path: "app_file_path"
)
```
or if you want to used custom_id.

```
upload_to_lambdatest(
    lt_username: ENV["LT_USERNAME"],
    lt_access_key: ENV["LT_ACCESS_KEY"],
    file_path: "<app_file_path>",
    custom_id: "<custom_id>
)
```
**_NOTE:_**  custom_id is an optional field.

**Step 3:** Once the app is uploaded to <BrandName />, this action will set an identifier to the uploaded app as APP_URL in the environment variable and can be accessed in the test.

```
String app = System.getenv("APP_URL");
capabilities.setCapability("app", app);
```

**Step 4:**  Execute the below command to upload app and run tests.

```
fastlane <lane>
```
