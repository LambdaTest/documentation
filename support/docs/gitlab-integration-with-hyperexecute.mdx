# GitLab Integration with HyperExecute
* * *

GitLab is a web-based Git repository that provides free open and private repositories, issue-following capabilities, and wikis. It is a complete DevOps platform that enables professionals to perform all the tasks in a project—from project planning and source code management to monitoring and security.

This document will show you how to integrate GitLab Pipeline with HyperExecute to greatly shorten your test cycles.

## How To Integrate GitLab Pipeline with Hyperexecute

***

To integrate GitLab Pipeline with HyperExecute, follow the below steps: 

You can use your own project to configure and test it. For demo purposes, we are using the sample repository.

<Tip>
**Sample repo**

Download or Clone the code sample from the <BrandName /> GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

</Tip>

### 1. Log into your GitLab account

### 2. Create a New Project

To create a new project and connect your external repository to GitLab CI/CD, click the **Run CI/CD for external repository** tab on the bottom right.

### 3. Connect Your External Repository:

On GitLab, you can either connect your external repository from [GitHub](https://www.github.com) or by URL. In this example, we will connect our external repository by URL. 

To connect your external repository by URL, fill in the required information in the form below and click the **Create Project** button at the bottom of the page.

### 4. Configure the Pipeline
- To configure the new pipeline that you just created, click the **Configure Pipeline** button in the center of the page.

<p></p>

- Create a new `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of the repository.

Below is a sample of GitLab YAML created for your reference:

```bash
## Define the image to use (adjust for macOS if needed)
image: ubuntu:latest

## Define pipelines (can have multiple pipelines)
pipelines:
  ## Default pipeline (can be named differently)
  default:
    ## Branches to trigger this pipeline on (adjust as needed)
    branches:
      - master

    ## Define steps in the pipeline
    steps:
      ## Download Hyperexecute CLI (descriptive name)
      - name: Download Hyperexecute CLI
        script: |
          wget https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
          chmod u+x hyperexecute

      ## Run Hyperexecute tests (descriptive name)
      - name: Run Hyperexecute Tests
        script: |
          ./hyperexecute --user <your_user_name> --key <your_access_key> --config <your_yaml_file_path>
```

### 5. Run Your Job
- To commit your changes and run your job, click the **Commit Changes** button.
