## Objective

---

By the end of this topic, you will know:

1. How can we use Katalon Spy with <BrandName />.
2. How can we record interactions using Katalon Record Mobile and create Automation Scripts.
3. Executing Katalon Scripts using <BrandName />’s real device cloud.

## Prerequisites for Getting Started

---

Before you can start performing App automation using Katalon Studio with <BrandName />, you would need to follow these steps:

- You will need a <BrandName /> username and access key. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [automation dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).
- [Katalon Studio](https://katalon.com/)
- Access to an Android app (.apk) or an iOS app (.ipa).

<Tip>
**- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on <BrandName /> by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).**

- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `APP_URL` of the format - ``lt://APP123456789123456789`` and will be used in the next steps.

## Katalon Spy with TestMu AI

---

### 1. Katalon Studio Web Interface
Once you have started Katalon Studio, load your project/ one of the sample projects provided by Katalon using the [web interface](https://my.katalon.com/home).

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/001.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

Once the project has been created, we can now move to the Katalon Studio on Windows/Mac.

### 2. Katalon Studio on PC
Open the Katalon Studio on the Windows/Mac:

Click on File > Open Project.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/002.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

### 3. Fetch Project & add credentials
Now we can click on Fetch Project > which will list all the Projects and make a selection.

Add in the Username & Personal Access Token & click Ok.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/003.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

Now we can see that there are 2 icons:

The first one is the Katalon Spy and the next one is the Katalon Mobile Record.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/004.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

### 4. Katalon Spy Kick-start

### 5. Edit Configuration
Click on Edit Configuration

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/006.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

#### a. Hub URL
Now we need to fill in the details for Remote Server URL that will be found on your App Automation Dashboard.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/007.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

Copy the Hub URL and add it to the Remote Server URL from the App Automation Dashboard.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/008.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

For the rest of the details, quickly head over to [Capabilities Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/) and now we can proceed with the next steps.

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/009.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

#### b. Desired Capabilities
Add in all the [Desired Capabilities](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/) as shown below, then click Apply and Close.

**Mandatory Capabilities:**
```java
"platformName", "android";
"deviceName", "Pixel 6";
"platformVersion", "12";
"isRealMobile", true;
```

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/010.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

Now for the last step we need the App ID.

Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the TestMu AI servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your TestMu AI **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for the authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request if required. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

 **Using App File from System:**

 ```bash

curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"" 

```

**Using App URL:**

```bash

curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "url=:https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk" -F "name=Proverbial_App" 

```

<img loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/katalon-integration-realDevices/011.webp' alt="katalon integration" width="1365" height="652" />

{/* We can easily fetch it from the App Live Dashboard and add it in the Cloud Application ID section:
