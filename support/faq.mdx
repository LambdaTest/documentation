</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why are you running Windows server edition? It is the same as Windows desktop edition?">
Microsoft Windows Desktop Editions licences does not support remote access to users. So we use Windows Server editions and implement Desktop experience in it. It has exactly the same experience as Windows desktop editions and they are running Internet Explorers made for desktop editions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title={`How much time it takes ${brandName} to add new browser version when it's released?`}>
Whenever a new stable browser version is released we usually implement it in our platform within a week. We also test them ourselves first before providing it to customers to make sure that testing experience is optimum for all users.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are operating systems 32 bit or 64 bit?">
Here are the operating systems and browsers running on 32 Bit Operating systems. Windows XP: Internet Explorer 8 , Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera Windows 7: Internet Explorer 8, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera Here are the operating system and browsers running on 64 Bit operating systems.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Would I be able to use keyboard shortcuts like copy paste in remote desktops?">
You would have full access to all keyboard shortcuts. For people using same operating systems on both their local computer and virtual machine won't have any problems. However people who are using Mac machines to access Windows VM or Windows machine to access Mac VM, would have to careful about OS specific shortcuts. For example when working on Mac OS, use Control Key instead of command key for copy pasting.
Yes you can. You would have full access to download and upload functionalities. You can access Downloads folder through File - Open file, or Control+O shortcut. Be advised however, each downloaded file will be automatically erased on shutting down the sessions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Would I be able to change browser settings?">
You would have full access to all browsers settings. Be advised however, if you need very specific browser settings, you would have to re-configure browser settings on starting each new session.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I am not able to properly hear the sound in the virtual machine. What is happening?">
For Chrome and Firefox browsers, you should be able to access audio streaming and therefore should be able to hear sounds properly. For mobile emulators, Internet Explorer, and Safari, we currently dont have support to provide you access to Audio. It's because of the inherent technology involved in these browsers. We are working on a workaround though so let's see.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How many simultaneous sessions can I start using one account?">
In the free plan you can run only one session at a time. Paid plan users can run multiple sessions depending upon their plan. Visit [<BrandName /> Pricing page](https://www.lambdatest.com/pricing) to checkout multiple session plans and their pricing.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="It is showing 'Session Limit reached' error even though I am not running a session.">
The number of sessions is limited by number of sessions running by a organization, not by user. Therefore it is entirely possible that you reach out of session limit even if only one or two users are using <BrandName /> tool. Co-ordinate with your teammates in this case. If you are sure there is session issue from our end, you can raise a ticket at our support portal. Don't worry, we have a very fast turnaround time.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What happens when I leave the session idle?">
By default, if you leave the Lamdatest Live session idle for 5 minutes, the app will prompt a reminder. If no action is taken then <BrandName /> would close the live session. You can change this setting from Live settings options. Checkout this link to understand more about it.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What happens when I switch to another tab in my browser?">
Switching tab won't stop or pause the Live session. If left idle for 5 minutes or more, <BrandName /> will prompt a reminder and if unanswered will close the session.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="When you give the machine to somebody else would they be able to access my history and saved passwords?">

The moment you close the session, <BrandName /> automatically sanitize the whole virtual machine. What that means is that we delete all historical data, downloads, installed extensions, saved passwords, etc. We reset the browsers to factory settings. This automatically logs you out of all pages and auto deletes all data that you may have saved. You would still have access to screenshots and issues you may have generated during the session.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Would i have to reset and re-configure browser settings everytime I create a new session?">

Yes! Every time you close a session we would reset all settings. We are working on a way to help you change and save a set of customized default browser settings. If your need is critical and changing browser settings in each new session takes a lot of your time, send us a message from here. We will try to find a solution for you.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="It is showing that my IP is blocked. Why did this happen? How do I unblock it?">

There may be a number of reasons why this happened which include <BrandName /> test flagged the IP for excessive spam registrations. <BrandName /> flagged the IP for violating terms of use or privacy policy To prevent our system from spam or security threats If you think that your IP has been flagged erroneously, raise a ticket at our support centre.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="It is showing parallel user limit reached. What does that mean?">

<BrandName /> test system allows only a limited number of concurrent running sessions per organization. This limit is defined by the plan that you have subscribed. If you need more concurrent sessions, you can change your plan, or contact one of our sales executive.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title={`I found a bug and now I want to take a screenshot of the webpage running on ${brandName} real time browser. How can I do that? Where are they saved?`}>
It's simple. In real time browser, on left side you will find multiple action buttons in the controller. One of them will be a screenshot button with camera icon. Just click that and in no time your screenshot will be recorded. Once recorded, an image editor will pop up where you can edit the screenshot, mark it as a bug and comment about the details. Lastly, you can find them anytime in test logs section of the menu.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I report the issue to my team? How can I check the issues created by my organization and team? And can I still report a bug if I am the only one in team?">

WebdriverIO is a browser and automation test framework based in Node.js. Adding helper functions in WebDriverIO is really simple in WebDriverIO. Also, it can run both on WebDriver protocol and Chrome Devtools protocol, making it efficient for both Selenium Webdriver based cross browser testing or Chromium based automation. To top it off, since WebDriverIO is open source, you get a bunch of plugins for your automation needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I Mark My Test As Pass Or Fail?">

The <BrandName /> Selenium grid doesn’t identify if you test ‘passed’ or ‘failed’. It only identifies whether a test has executed to it’s last command or whether it has stopped/timed-out before it. The user would have to pass on these parameters to <BrandName /> platform to make it possible for tracking these values at <BrandName /> platform. Make use of <BrandName /> API or <BrandName /> Annotations, for pushing additional metadata to <BrandName /> or to track the pass/fail status of a test.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I Run Parallel Testing using JUnit Framework?">

Yes! One of the key features of <BrandName /> Selenium grid is the ability to run your test cases in parallel. Which means you can execute numerous automation test cases altogether and enable you to cut down on test times. With <BrandName /> Selenium grid you can run a single test scenario across different browsers or different test scenarios with the same browser (or any other combinations). Wondering how many parallel test cases can you run? That depends entirely on the number of concurrent sessions under your opted plan.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What Is The Maximum Queuing Capacity?">

Maximum number of test cases that can be queued = n + 150 Here, n = number of concurrent sessions. For instance, if you are opting for pricing where you can avail up to 10 concurrent sessions. Then the maximum number of test cases that can be queued will be equal to 10 + 150 i.e. 160 queued test cases. <BrandName /> would automatically schedule and execute test cases for you. We have added a capacity constraint on the number of tests that can be queued to prevent over-exploitation of the platform. Refer <BrandName /> Queuing Policy to know more.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How Many Parallel Sessions Do I Need?">

[<BrandName /> Concurrency Calculator](https://www.lambdatest.com/concurrency-calculator/) is here to help you calculate the number of parallel sessions you need for your test coverage. Feed the information to our Concurrency Calculator, and it would suggest to you the appropriate number of parallel sessions.

<Accordion title="Which testing frameworks does HyperExecute support?">

Though HyperExecute has a [very deep support](/support/docs/hyperexecute-supported-languages-and-frameworks/) for Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, CDP, Taiko and other web browser testing frameworks, nothing stops it from running any other tests over the HyperExecute platform using YAML. Core orchestration features and real time logs are native to the platform and will be available over any kind of testing.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I run a specific command before running tests on HyperExecute?">

HyperExecute provides you with smart CI features where you can run any command before and after running tests using pre and post steps. Common use cases include, building/ compiling binaries, downloading dependencies, starting services in the background or any other arbitrary command.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Where will HyperExecute run my tests?">

HyperExecute takes your test scripts and places them in virtual machines having all the components required to run your tests and collect logs and metrics. These virtual machines are hosted by HyperExecute in its secure cloud environment. HyperExecute is also available on dedicated and private clouds where virtual machines can run in your personal cloud accounts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How to use HyperExecute?">

Tests are triggered on HyperExecute using HyperExecute CLI using a YAML file to configure the executing settings including target OS, concurrency and other CI level information. This YAML file can be generated easily using a web based YAML generator that supports multiple languages and frameworks. As a user you need to focus on writing tests and running the CLI with YAML, everything else is taken care of by the orchestration platform.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is HyperExecute faster than other end to end testing platforms?">

HyperExecute collects every possible log, including terminal logs, selenium and more (for every single test), and stores them separately from each other. These isolated logs ensure that the end user is not spending time in filtering useful logs and focuses on getting the insights from the logs as fast as possible. HyperExecute also streams these test logs in real time to drastically reduce time wasted in debugging failed tests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does HyperExecute provide the ability to store test artifacts?">

Yes, HyperExecute provides convenient artifact management where you can upload test artifacts or any files or folders generated during test execution. These artifacts are stored on HyperExecute. HyperExecute exposes APIs to access these as well.

You can do this by [directly calling the parameter keys](/support/docs/hyperexecute-yaml-faqs/#8-how-can-i-use-the-jenkins-job-choice-parameters-in-the-yaml-file) in the HyperExecute YAML file and use the Jenkins choice parameters.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I run a lot of tests with the same YAML configurations. Is there any way where I can run my tests without specifying the same configurations over and over again?">

You can solve this problem by using HyperExecute's inheritance feature. This feature allows you to inherit the configurations of a base YAML file and saves you the time of configuring the YAML file multiple times. To learn more about how to use this feature, go through [this page](/support/docs/hyperexecute-inherit-config/).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I want to test the code in my Git repository. Is there a way where I can accomplish that with HyperExecute?">

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Briefly describe your security policies.">
<BrandName /> is a firm believer in secure experience and multifaceted security protocols, to ensure that every aspect including architecture, engineering, testing, and deployment, follows and complies with industry leading standards of security. As first line of defense, <BrandName /> application is protected by AWS’s firewalls which are tasked with countering regular DDoS attacks and malicious network intrusions. The next line of defense is <BrandName />’s own application firewall protocols which are tasked with protecting the application against spam, ill-intent users, and malicious IP. We have also implemented secure user access policies for accessing <BrandName /> platform and only users with valid user credentials can access the application. We have also implemented role based access to the application, each role having different access levels.

Whenever a user initiates a test at <BrandName /> platform, they are allotted a thoroughly sanitized virtual machine. And as soon as a session ends, all data including cookies, registry, caches, and running processes are deleted and all browser settings are reset to default values. Each virtual machine has to pass a series of automated tests before it is used again. Any machine that fails a test gets redacted from the pool for auditing and manual cleaning. At the time of test only the user has access to machine and not even <BrandName /> has access to the user’s running test session. All machines have strict security protocols that prohibit any user from installing any external software in the machines.

In our application we have implemented HTTPS by default, and use VNC protocols for secure data transfer. This data is also encrypted to ensure that data is not compromised in-transit.

All our hosting centers are chosen based on their record of established security policies and excellent history. Our selection process is rigorous and we partner with only the best providers across globe that have been certified by major compliance regulators.

All data saved in our application like login credentials, secure access keys, usage logs, test history, and billing details, are stored in an encrypted format.

We have implemented strict 24×7 security protections at our on-premise development centers. Only authorized individuals have access to building and <BrandName /> office premises. Our application data is hosted on industry leading hosts like Amazon Web Services, who have been thoroughly tested by multiple third party auditors for security. You can also read more about Amazon Web Service’s [Security AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do you have a disaster recovery (DR) or Business Continuity Plan (BCP) plan? How often is it tested?">
<BrandName /> has a formal Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) defined and implemented to enable people, process, and technology support during any crisis or business interruptions. The BC and DR Plan is tested and reviewed on a yearly basis. And, Disaster Recovery (DR) program ensures that our Services remain available and are easily recoverable in the case of a disaster. This is accomplished through building a robust technical environment and creating Disaster Recovery plans and testing activities. In the event of a disaster, the following objectives apply:

1. **4-hour Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** <BrandName /> will aim to restore normal operations for your <BrandName /> platform account within four hours from the time a disaster is declared, unless a disaster, or multiple disasters, impacts all of the Availability Zones used on an account.

2. **Under 1-hour Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** <BrandName /> will target one hour or less of data loss for your account. This is calculated from the point of the disruption, not from <BrandName />’s disaster declaration.

Also, <BrandName /> employs service clustering and network redundancies to eliminate single points of failure. Our strict backup regime and/or our Disaster Recovery service offering allows us to deliver a high service availability, as customer or test data is replicated across availability zones. For more details, please refer to [<BrandName /> Trust](https://www.testmu.ai/trust/security/#business-continuity-and-disaster-recovery) page.
